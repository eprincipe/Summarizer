Quarterly profits at US media giant TimeWarner jumped to bn for the three months to December from year-earlier 
The firm which is now one of the biggest investors in Google benefited from sales of high-speed internet connections and higher advert sales 
TimeWarner said fourth quarter sales rose to bn from bn 
Its profits were buoyed by one-off gains which offset profit dip at Warner Bros and less users for AOL 
Time Warner said on Friday that it now owns of search-engine Google 
But its own internet business AOL had has mixed fortunes 
It lost subscribers in the fourth quarter profits were lower than in the preceding three quarters 
However the company said AOL's underlying profit before exceptional items rose on the back of stronger internet advertising revenues 
It hopes to increase subscribers by offering the online service free to TimeWarner internet customers and will try to sign up AOL's existing customers for high-speed broadband 
TimeWarner also has to restate and results following probe by the US Securities Exchange Commission SEC which is close to concluding 
Time Warner's fourth quarter profits were slightly better than analysts' expectations 
But its film division saw profits slump to helped by box-office flops Alexander and Catwoman sharp contrast to year-earlier when the third and final film in the Lord of the Rings trilogy boosted results 
For the full-year TimeWarner posted profit of bn up from its performance while revenues grew to bn 
Our financial performance was strong meeting or exceeding all of our full-year objectives and greatly enhancing our flexibility chairman and chief executive Richard Parsons said 
For TimeWarner is projecting operating earnings growth of around and also expects higher revenue and wider profit margins 
TimeWarner is to restate its accounts as part of efforts to resolve an inquiry into AOL by US market regulators 
It has already offered to pay to settle charges in deal that is under review by the SEC 
The company said it was unable to estimate the amount it needed to set aside for legal reserves which it previously set at 
It intends to adjust the way it accounts for deal with German music publisher Bertelsmann's purchase of stake in AOL Europe which it had reported as advertising revenue 
It will now book the sale of its stake in AOL Europe as loss on the value of that stake

The dollar has hit its highest level against the euro in almost three months after the Federal Reserve head said the US trade deficit is set to stabilise 
And Alan Greenspan highlighted the US government's willingness to curb spending and rising household savings as factors which may help to reduce it 
In late trading in New York the dollar reached against the euro from on Thursday 
Market concerns about the deficit has hit the greenback in recent months 
On Friday Federal Reserve chairman Mr Greenspan's speech in London ahead of the meeting of finance ministers sent the dollar higher after it had earlier tumbled on the back of worse-than-expected US jobs data 
think the chairman's taking much more sanguine view on the current account deficit than he's taken for some time said Robert Sinche head of currency strategy at Bank of America in New York 
He's taking longer-term view laying out set of conditions under which the current account deficit can improve this year and next 

Worries about the deficit concerns about China do however remain 
China's currency remains pegged to the dollar and the US currency's sharp falls in recent months have therefore made Chinese export prices highly competitive 
But calls for shift in Beijing's policy have fallen on deaf ears despite recent comments in major Chinese newspaper that the time is ripe for loosening of the peg 
The meeting is thought unlikely to produce any meaningful movement in Chinese policy 
In the meantime the US Federal Reserve's decision on February to boost interest rates by quarter of point the sixth such move in as many months has opened up differential with European rates 
The half-point window some believe could be enough to keep US assets looking more attractive and could help prop up the dollar 
The recent falls have partly been the result of big budget deficits as well as the US's yawning current account gap both of which need to be funded by the buying of US bonds and assets by foreign firms and governments 
The White House will announce its budget on Monday and many commentators believe the deficit will remain at close to half trillion dollars

The owners of embattled Russian oil giant Yukos are to ask the buyer of its former production unit to pay back loan 
State-owned Rosneft bought the Yugansk unit for bn in sale forced by Russia to part settle bn tax claim against Yukos 
Yukos' owner Menatep Group says it will ask Rosneft to repay loan that Yugansk had secured on its assets 
Rosneft already faces similar repayment demand from foreign banks 
Legal experts said Rosneft's purchase of Yugansk would include such obligations 
The pledged assets are with Rosneft so it will have to pay real money to the creditors to avoid seizure of Yugansk assets said Moscow-based US lawyer Jamie Firestone who is not connected to the case 
Menatep Group's managing director Tim Osborne told the Reuters news agency If they default we will fight them where the rule of law exists under the international arbitration clauses of the credit 

Rosneft officials were unavailable for comment 
But the company has said it intends to take action against Menatep to recover some of the tax claims and debts owed by Yugansk 
Yukos had filed for bankruptcy protection in US court in an attempt to prevent the forced sale of its main production arm 
The sale went ahead in December and Yugansk was sold to little-known shell company which in turn was bought by Rosneft 
Yukos claims its downfall was punishment for the political ambitions of its founder Mikhail Khodorkovsky and has vowed to sue any participant in the sale

British Airways has blamed high fuel prices for drop in profits

Rod Eddington BA's chief executive said the results were respectable in third quarter when fuel costs rose by or 
BA's profits were still better than market expectation of and it expects rise in full-year revenues 
To help offset the increased price of aviation fuel BA last year introduced fuel surcharge for passengers 
In October it increased this from to one-way for all long-haul flights while the short-haul surcharge was raised from to leg 
Yet aviation analyst Mike Powell of Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein says BA's estimated annual surcharge revenues will still be way short of its additional fuel costs predicted extra 
Turnover for the quarter was up to bn further benefiting from rise in cargo revenue 
Looking ahead to its full year results to March BA warned that yields average revenues per passenger were expected to decline as it continues to lower prices in the face of competition from low-cost carriers 
However it said sales would be better than previously forecast 
For the year to March the total revenue outlook is slightly better than previous guidance with to improvement anticipated BA chairman Martin Broughton said 
BA had previously forecast to rise in full-year revenue 
It also reported on Friday that passenger numbers rose in January 
Aviation analyst Nick Van den Brul of BNP Paribas described BA's latest quarterly results as pretty modest 
It is quite good on the revenue side and it shows the impact of fuel surcharges and positive cargo development however operating margins down and cost impact of fuel are very strong he said 
Since the September attacks in the United States BA has cut jobs as part of major cost-cutting drive 
Our focus remains on reducing controllable costs and debt whilst continuing to invest in our products Mr Eddington said 
For example we have taken delivery of six Airbus aircraft and next month we will start further improvements to our Club World flat beds

Shares in UK drinks and food firm Allied Domecq have risen on speculation that it could be the target of takeover by France's Pernod Ricard 
Reports in the Wall Street Journal and the Financial Times suggested that the French spirits firm is considering bid but has yet to contact its target 
Allied Domecq shares in London rose by GMT while Pernod shares in Paris slipped 
Pernod said it was seeking acquisitions but refused to comment on specifics 
Pernod's last major purchase was third of US giant Seagram in the move which propelled it into the global top three of drinks firms 
The other two-thirds of Seagram was bought by market leader Diageo

Revised figures indicated growth of just and similar-sized contraction in the previous quarter 
On an annual basis the data suggests annual growth of just suggesting much more hesitant recovery than had previously been thought 
common technical definition of recession is two successive quarters of negative growth 
The government was keen to play down the worrying implications of the data

But in the face of the strengthening yen making exports less competitive and indications of weakening economic conditions ahead observers were less sanguine

The US created fewer jobs than expected in January but fall in jobseekers pushed the unemployment rate to its lowest level in three years 
According to Labor Department figures US firms added only jobs in January 
The gain in non-farm payrolls was below market expectations of new jobs 
Nevertheless it was enough to push down the unemployment rate to its lowest level since September 
The job gains mean that President Bush can celebrate albeit by very fine margin net growth in jobs in the US economy in his first term in office 
He presided over net fall in jobs up to last November's Presidential election the first President to do so since Herbert Hoover 
As result job creation became key issue in last year's election 
However when adding December and January's figures the administration's first term jobs record ended in positive territory 
The Labor Department also said it had revised down the jobs gains in December from to 
Analysts said the growth in new jobs was not as strong as could be expected given the favourable economic conditions 
It suggests that employment is continuing to expand at moderate pace said Rick Egelton deputy chief economist at BMO Financial Group 
We are not getting the boost to employment that we would have got given the low value of the dollar and the still relatively low interest rate environment 
The economy is producing moderate but not satisfying amount of job growth said Ken Mayland president of ClearView Economics 
That means there are limited number of new opportunities for workers

India which attends the meeting of seven leading industrialised nations on Friday is unlikely to be cowed by its newcomer status 
In London on Thursday ahead of the meeting India's finance minister lashed out at the restrictive trade policies of the nations 
He objected to subsidies on agriculture that make it hard for developing nations like India to compete 
He also called for reform of the United Nations the World Bank and the IMF 
Palaniappan Chidambaram India's finance minister argued that these organisations need to take into account the changing world order given India and China's integration into the global economy

The alliance comes as badly-needed boost for loss-making Mitsubishi after several profit warnings and poor sales 
The SUVs will be built in Japan using Peugeot's diesel engines and sold mainly in the European market 
Falling sales have left Mitsubishi Motors with underused capacity and the production deal with Peugeot gives it chance to utilise some of it 
In January Mitsubishi Motors issued its third profits warning in nine months and cut its sales forecasts for the year to March

The Daily and Sunday Telegraph newspapers are axing journalist jobs of their editorial staff 
The Telegraph Group says the cuts are needed to fund an investment in new printing facilities 
Journalists at the firm met on Friday afternoon to discuss how to react to the surprise announcement 
The cuts come against background of fierce competition for readers and sluggish advertising revenues amid competition from online advertising 
The National Union of Journalists has called on the management to recall the notice of redundancy by midday on Monday or face strike ballot 
Pearson's Financial Times said last week it was offering voluntary redundancy to about reporters 
The National Union of Journalists said it stood strongly behind the journalists and did not rule out strike 
Managers have torn up agreed procedures and kicked staff in the teeth by sacking people to pay for printing facilities said Jeremy Dear NUJ General Secretary 
NUJ official Barry Fitzpatrick said the company had ignored the -day consultation period required for companies planning more than redundancies 
They have shown complete disregard for the consultative rights of our members said Mr Fitzpatrick who added that the company now planned to observe the consultation procedures 
The two Telegraph titles currently employ journalists 
Some broadsheet newspapers especially those which have not moved to tabloid format have suffered circulation declines which are hitting revenues 
The Telegraph has announced no plans to go tabloid although both The Independent and The Times have seen circulation rise since shrinking in size 
The Guardian is hedging its bets planning larger tabloid format like those popular in continental Europe 
The Telegraph Group was bought by the Barclay twins Frederick and David last year having previously been owned by Lord Conrad Black's Hollinger International

However action to improve our production capability and secure our titles against the competition is also vital 
Many newspapers are investing in new printing machinery that enables them to print more colour pages or in some cases have colour on every page

Air passengers who are unable to board their flights because of overbooking cancellations or flight delays can now demand greater compensation 
New EU rules set compensation at between euros and euros depending on the length of the flight 
The new rules will apply to all scheduled and charter flights including budget airlines 
Airlines have attacked the legislation saying they could be forced to push prices higher to cover the extra cost 
The European Commission is facing two legal challenges one from the European Low-fare Airlines Association ELAA and the other from the International Air Transport Association IATA which has attacked the package as bad piece of legislation 
Previously passengers could claim between euros and euros if they had been stopped from boarding 
However only scheduled flight operators were obliged to offer compensation in cases of overbooking and they did not have to offer compensation for flight cancellations 
The EU decided to increase passenger compensation in bid to deter airlines from deliberately overbooking flights 
Overbooking can often lead to 'bumping' when passenger is moved to later flight 
When this happens against passenger's will airlines will now have to offer compensation 
In addition if flight is cancelled or delayed for more than two hours through the fault of the airline all passengers must be paid compensation 
However airlines do not have to offer compensation if flights are cancelled or delayed due to extraordinary circumstances 
Airlines fear that extraordinary circumstances may not include bad weather security alerts or strikes events which are outside of their control 
All EU-based airlines and operators of flights which take off from the EU will have to adhere to the new compensation regime which came into force on Thursday 
Low-cost airlines have criticised the new compensation levels arguing that the pay-out could be worth more than the ticket 
It's preposterous piece of legislation we among all airlines are fighting this Ryanair deputy chief executive Michael Cawley told Radio 's Today programme 
The European Regions Airline Association ERAA claims that neither airlines nor consumers were consulted over the changes 
Andy Clarke ERAA director of air transport said that the EC advice misleads customers as it leads them to believe that airlines could be liable for payouts if flights are delayed because of bad weather 
EC spokeswoman Marja Quillinan-Meiland conceded there were grey areas but said these are not as big as the airlines are making out 
In cases of dispute national enforcement bodies would decide whether the passenger had case she said 
New technology means it is easier for airlines to take off and land in bad weather she added 
The ERAA's Mr Clarke also warned that while airlines would comply with the new rules the extra costs would be passed onto passengers 
We reckon it's going to cost European air passengers not the airlines the airlines have no money it has to be paid by passengers bn euros that's over bn year loaded onto European passengers Mr Clarke said 
That's basically transfer of money from passengers whose journeys are not disrupted to passengers whose journeys are disrupted 

On Wednesday Jacques Barrot vice president of the European Commission and also Commissioner for Transport said that the changes were necessary 
The boom in air travel needs to be accompanied by proper protection of passengers' right 
This is concrete example of how the Union benefits people's daily lives he added 
The EC has launched an information campaign in airports and travel agencies to inform airline passengers of their new rights

The breakneck pace of economic expansion has kept growth above for more than year 
Rapid tooling-up of China's manufacturing sector means massive demand for energy one of the factors which has kept world oil prices sky-high for most of this year

Customers trying to get through to call centres are getting impatient and quicker to hang up survey suggests 
Once past the welcome message callers on average hang up after just seconds of listening to canned music 
The drop in patience comes as the number of calls to call centres is growing at rate of every year 
Customers are getting used to the idea of an 'always available' society says Cara Diemont of IT firm Dimension Data which commissioned the survey 
However call centres also saw sharp increase of customers simply abandoning calls she says from just over in to record during last year 
When automated phone message systems are taken out of the equation where customers have to pick their way through multiple options and messages the number of abandoned calls is even higher sixth of all callers give up rather than wait 
One possible reason for the lack in patience Ms Diemont says is the fact that more customers are calling 'on the move' using their mobile phones 
The surge in customers trying to get through to call centres is also reflection of the centres' growing range of tasks 
Once call centre may have looked after mortgages now its agents may also be responsible for credit cards insurance and current accounts Ms Diemont says 
Problems are occurring because increased responsibility is not going hand-in-hand with more training the survey found 
In what Dimension Data calls an alarming development the average induction time for call centre worker fell last year from to just days leaving agents not equipped to deal with customers 
This Ms Diemont warns is scary and not good for the bottom line either 
Poor training frustrates both call centre workers and customers 
As result call centres have high churn rate with nearly quarter of workers throwing in the towel every year which in turn forces companies to pay for training new staff 
Resolution rates the number of calls where customer's query is resolved to mutual satisfaction are running at just 
When the query is passed on to second or third person specialist or manager rates rise to about but that is still well below the industry target of an resolution rate 
Suggestions that outsourcing relocating call centres to low-cost countries like India or South Africa is to blame are wrong Ms Diemont says 
There are no big differences in wait time and call resolution between call centres based in Europe or North America and those in developing countries around the world 
You can make call centres perform anywhere if you have good management and the right processes in place she says 
However companies that decide to offshore their operations are driven not just by cost considerations 
Only of them say that saving money is the main consideration when closing domestic call centre operations 
Half of them argue that workers in other countries offer better skills for the money 
But not everybody believes that outsourcing and offshoring are the solution 
Nearly two-thirds of all firms polled for the survey have no plans to offshore their call centres 
They give three key reasons for not making the move 
call centre operations are part of their business core function 
they are worried about the risk of going abroad 
they fear that they will damage their brand if they join the offshoring drive 
The survey was conducted by Sunovate on behalf of Dimension Data and is based on in-depth questionnaires of call centres in countries and five continents 
What are your experiences with call centres 
Are you happy to listen to Vivaldi or Greensleeves or do you want an immediate response 
And if you work in call centre did your training prepare you for your job

The number of people out of work in Europe's largest economy has risen for the tenth straight month as growth remains stubbornly slow 
German unemployment rose in November to million people or of the workforce 
The seasonally adjusted rise showed smaller rise than expected as government measures to encourage job creation began to take effect 
But officials said stagnant growth was still stifling the job market 
There are clear signs of revival in domestic demand said Frank-Juergen Weise head of the Federal Labour Agency in statement 
But growth of 
in the third quarter is still insufficient to deliver positive momentum to the labour market 
High oil prices and the soaring euro which damages the competitiveness of exporters were also having negative effect he said 
The brunt of the unemployment is still being felt in the eastern part of Germany where the rate is 
With unemployment stuck above million for years the government of Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder has put job creation at the top of the agenda 
controversial package of measures to shake up incentives to get back to work paid for by cutting some cherished benefits has sparked anger among some German workers 
Strikes in number of industries notably among the country's iconic carmakers have demonstrated the displeasure as well as fears about further job losses as outsourcing takes hold 
Among the new initiatives are the so-called one-euro jobs which top up unemployment benefit 
The scheme's formal launch is January but hirings for these positions are already taking place and affecting the unemployment statistics economists said 
The deterioration of the labour market does not come as surprise said Isabelle Kronawitter at Hypovereinsbank 
Job creation measures probably prevented stronger increase in the seasonally adjusted numbers

The gap between US exports and imports hit an all-time high of bn bn in latest figures show 
The Commerce Department said the trade deficit for all of last year was above the previous record 's imbalance of bn 
The deficit with China up at bn was the largest ever recorded with single country 
However on monthly basis the US trade gap narrowed by in December to bn 
The US consumer's appetite for all things from oil to imported cars and even wine and cheese reached record levels last year and the figures are likely to spark fresh criticism of President Bush's economic policies 
Democrats claim the administration has not done enough to clamp down on unfair foreign trade practices 
For example they believe China's currency policy which US manufacturers claim has undervalued the yuan by as much as has given China's rapidly expanding economy an unfair advantage against US competitors 
Meanwhile the Bush administration argues that the US deficit reflects the fact the America is growing at faster rate than the rest of the world spurring on more demand for imported goods 
Some economists say this may allow an upward revision of US economic growth in the fourth quarter 
But others point out that the deficit has reached such astronomical proportions that foreigners many choose not to hold as many dollar-denominated assets which may in turn harm growth 
For all of US exports rose to trillion but imports rose even faster by to new record of trillion 
Foreign oil exports surged by to record bn reflecting the rally in global oil prices and increasing domestic demand 
Imports were not affected by the dollar's weakness last year 
We expect the deficit to continue to widen in even if the dollar gets back to its downward trend said economist Marie-Pierre Ripert at IXIS

judge has dismissed an attempt by Russian oil giant Yukos to gain bankruptcy protection in the US 
Yukos filed for Chapter protection in Houston in an unsuccessful attempt to halt the auction of its Yugansk division by the Russian authorities 
The court ruling is blow to efforts to get damages for the sale of Yugansk which Yukos claims was illegally sold 
Separately former Yukos boss Mikhail Khodorkovsky began testimony on Friday in his trial for fraud and tax evasion 
Mr Khodorkovsky who has been in jail for more than year pleaded not guilty to the charges brought against him and denied involvement in any criminal activities 
pride myself on heading for years number of successful companies and helping other enterprises rise from their knees he told Russian court 
Yugansk was auctioned to help pay off bn bn in unpaid taxes 
It was bought for bn by previously-unknown group which was in turn bought up almost immediately by state-controlled oil company Rosneft 
Texas Judge Letitia Clark said Yukos did not have enough of US presence to establish US jurisdiction 
The vast majority of the business and financial activities of Yukos continue to occur in Russia Judge Clark said in her ruling 
Such activities require the continued participation of the Russian government 
Yukos had argued that US court was entitled to declare it bankrupt before its Yugansk unit was sold since it has local bank accounts and its chief finance officer Bruce Misamore lives in Houston 
Yukos claimed it sought help in the US because other forums Russian courts and the European Court of Human Rights were either unfriendly or offered less protection 
Russia had indicated it would in any case not abide by the rulings of the US courts 
In her ruling the judge acknowledged that it appears likely that agencies of the Russian government have acted in manner that would be considered confiscatory under United States law 
But she said her role was simply to decide on jurisdiction 
The US court's jurisdiction had been challenged by Deutsche Bank and Gazpromneft former unit of Russian gas monopoly Gazprom which is due to merge with Rosneft 
Analysts said the ability of Gazprom and Rosneft to trade freely overseas had been stifled while the ownership of Yugansk remained unclear 
Yukos said it would consider its options in light of the ruling 
However it claimed that the court had backed its argument in four out of five key issues 
We believe the merits of our case are strong and simple said chief executive Steven Theede 
Our assets were illegally seized 
We want them back or damages paid

This is because of possible malfunctions with the braking systems 
The affected vehicles in the product recall are from the and model years GM said 
Those vehicles with potential faults are the Chevrolet Avalanche Express Kodiak Silverade and Suburban the GMC Savana Sierra and Yukon 
The NHTSA said pressure accumulator in the braking system could crack during normal driving and fragments could injure people if the hood was open 
This could allow hydraulic fluid to leak which could make it harder to brake or steer and could cause crash it warned 
GM is also recalling Cadillac XLR coupes SRX SUVs and Pontiac Grand Prix sedans from the model year 
This is because the accelerator pedal may not work properly in extremely cold temperatures requiring more braking 
In addition the car giant is calling back Buick Raniers Chevrolet Trailblazers GMC Envoys and Isuzu Ascenders from the model years because the windshield is not properly fitted and could fall out in crash 
However GM stressed that it did not know of any injuries related to the problems

Venezuelan authorities have said they will seize land owned by British company as part of President Chavez's agrarian reform programme 
Officials in Cojedes state said on Friday that farmland owned by subsidiary of the Vestey Group would be taken and used to settle poor farmers 
The government is cracking down on so-called latifundios or large rural estates which it says are lying idle 
The Vestey Group said it had not been informed of any planned seizure 
The firm whose Agroflora subsidiary operates farms in Venezuela insisted that it had complied fully with Venezuelan law 
Prosecutors in the south of the country have targeted Hato El Charcote beef cattle ranch owned by Agroflora 
According to Reuters they plan to seize acres hectares from the acre hectare farm 
Officials claim that Agroflora does not possess valid documents proving its ownership of the land in question 
They also allege that areas of the ranch are not being used for any form of active production 
The legal boundaries did not match up with the actual boundaries and there is surplus state prosecutor Alexis Ortiz told Reuters 
As consequence the government has taken action 

Controversial reforms passed in give the government the right to take control of private property if it is declared idle or ownership cannot be traced back to the th Century 
Critics say the powers which President Chavez argues are needed to help the country's poorest citizens and develop the Venezuelan economy trample all over private property rights 
The Vestey Group said it had owned the land since and would co-operate fully with the authorities 
But spokesman added Agroflora is absolutely confident that what it has submitted will demonstrate the legality of its title to the land 
The company pointed out that the farm which employs workers provides meat solely for the Venezuelan market 
Last month the government said it had identified more than idle farms and had yet to consider the status of further 
The authorities said landowners whose titles were in order and whose farms were productive had nothing to fear 
Under President Chavez the Venezuelan government has steadily expanded the state's involvement in the country's economy 
It recently said all mining contracts involving foreign firms would be examined to ensure they provided sufficient economic benefits to the state

The price of crude is about higher than it was at the start of but down on the record high of set in late October 
dip in oil prices and improving jobs prospects would improve consumer confidence and spending the OECD said 
The oil shock is not enormous by historical standards we have seen worse in the seventies 
If the oil price does not rise any further then we think the shock can be absorbed within the next few quarters Vincent Koen senior economist with the OECD told the BBC's World Business Report 
The recovery that was underway and has been interrupted bit by the oil shock this year would then regain momentum in the course of 
China's booming economy and spectacular comeback in Japan albeit one that has faltered in recent months would help world economic recovery the OECD said

Foreign firms have been given an extra year to meet tough new corporate governance regulations imposed by the US stock market watchdog 
The Securities and Exchange Commission has extended the deadline to get in line with the rules until July 
Many foreign firms had protested that the SEC was imposing an unfair burden 
The new rules are the result of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act part of the US clean-up after corporate scandals such as Enron and Worldcom 
Section of the Sox Act as the legislation is nicknamed calls for all firms to certify that their financial reporting is in line with US rules 
Big US firms already have to meet the requirements but smaller ones and foreign-based firms which list their shares on US stock markets originally had until the middle of this year 
Over the past few months delegations of European and other business leaders have been heading to the SEC's Washington DC headquarters to protest 
They say the burden is too expensive and the timescale too short and some particularly the UK's CBI warned that companies would choose to let their US listings drop rather than get in line with section 
The latest delegation from the CBI met SEC officials on Wednesday just before the decision to relax the deadline was announced 
think this signifies change of heart at the SEC CBI director-general Sir Digby Jones told the BBC's Today programme 
They have been listening to us and to many overseas companies who have reminded America what globalisation really means that they can't make these rules in isolation

One of Japan's best-known businessmen was arrested on Thursday on charges of falsifying shareholder information and selling shares based on the false data 
Yoshiaki Tsutsumi was once ranked as the world's richest man and ran business spanning hotels railways construction and baseball team 
His is the latest in series of arrests of top executives in Japan over business scandals 
He was taken away in van outside one of his Prince hotels in Tokyo 
There was time when Mr Tsutsumi seemed untouchable 
Inheriting large property business from his father in the he became one of Japan's most powerful industrialists with close connections to many of the country's leading politicians 
He used his wealth and influence to bring the Winter Olympic Games to Nagano in 
But last year he was forced to resign from all the posts he held in his business empire after being accused of falsifying the share-ownership structure of Seibu Railways one of his companies 
Under Japanese stock market rules no listed company can be more than owned by its largest shareholders 
Now Mr Tsutsumi faces criminal charges and the possibility of prison sentence because he made it look as if the biggest shareholders owned less than this amount 
Seibu Railways has been delisted from the stock exchange its share value has plunged and it is the target of takeover bid 
Mr Tsutsumi's fall from grace follows the arrests of several other top executives in Japan as the authorities try to curb the murky business practices which were once widespread in Japanese companies 
His determination to stay at the top at all costs may have had its roots in his childhood 
The illegitimate third son of rich father who made his money buying up property as Japan rebuilt after World War II he has described the demands his father made 
felt enormous pressure when dined with him and it was nothing but pain Tsutsumi told weekly magazine in 
He scolded me for pouring too much soy sauce or told me fruit was not for children 
He didn't let me use the silk futon saying it's luxury

Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan has warned that allowing huge US budget deficits to continue could have severe consequences 
Speaking to the House Budget Committee he urged Congress to take action to cut the deficit such as increasing taxes 
While the US economy is growing at reasonably good pace he warned that budget concerns were clouding the economic outlook for the US 
Pension and healthcare costs posed the greatest risks to the economy he said 
The government program faces severe financial strains in coming decades as the massive baby-boom generation retires 
fear that we may have already committed more physical resources to the baby-boom generation in its retirement years than our economy has the capacity to deliver 
If existing promises need to be changed those changes should be made sooner rather than later Mr Greenspan said 
He also warned that unless the nation sees unprecedented rises in productivity retirement and health programmes would need significant changes 
He called on Congress to cut promised benefits for retirees as the promised benefits for the soon-to-retire baby boom generation were much larger than the government could afford 
Meanwhile any move to narrow the deficit gap by raising taxes could pose significant risk to the economy by dampening growth and spending he added 
He also urged Congress to reinstate lapsed rules that require tax cuts and spending to be offset elsewhere in the budget in an effort to prevent the US heading further into the red 
Despite the dire warnings Mr Greenspan did offer some good news for the short term 
As US growth gathers steam and incomes rise that should lead to narrowing of the deficit 
Recent increases in defence and homeland security spending were also not expected to continue indefinitely which should cut some costs 
Since President George Bush came to office the federal budget has swung from record surplus to record deficit of bn last year

previous estimate of growth between July and September was downgraded to decline 
recession is commonly defined as two consecutive quarters of negative growth although the Japanese government takes other factors into account when judging the status of its economy 
Figures released by the government's Cabinet Office showed that GDP on an annualised basis fell in the last three months of 
However politicians remain upbeat about prospects for an economic boost later in the year 
The economy has some soft patches but if you look at the bigger picture it is in recovery stage said Economic and Fiscal Policy Minister Heizo Takenaka 
Gross domestic product measures the overall value of goods and services produced in country 
The economy must be assessed comprehensively and we cannot look at GDP alone Mr Takenaka stressed 
Ministers pointed to the fact that consumer spending had been depressed by one-off factors such as the unseasonably mild winter 
Analysts said the figures were disappointing but argued that Japan's largest companies had been recording healthy profits and capital spending was on the rise 
Japan's economy grew overall last year fuelled by strong performance in the first few months and is forecast to see growth of in 
However the economy's fragile recovery remains dependent on an upturn in consumer spending fall in the value of the yen and an improvement in global economies 
The results came in at the lower end of expectations but we shouldn't be too pessimistic about the current state and the outlook for the economy said Naoki Iizuka senior economist at the Dai-ichi Life Research Institute 
Japan's economy has seen stretches of moderate growth over the past decade but has periodically slipped back into recession

US crude prices have soared to fresh four-month highs above in the US as refinery problems propelled petrol prices to an all-time high 
US light sweet crude futures jumped to barrel in New York before closing at 
The gains tracked surge in US gasoline futures to record high of gallon 
The jump followed fire at Western Refining Company's refinery in Texas which shut down petrol production 
spokesman for the group was unable to say when the production unit would be back up and running 
This market simply wants to go up Citigroup Global Markets analyst Kyle Cooper told Reuters news agency 
Ed Silliere analyst at Energy Merchant added Gasoline is up because of the refinery issues in Texas which means there will be scramble for product in the US Gulf Coast 

Elsewhere refinery in Houston was closed due to mechanical problems while on Tuesday production at BP's Texas City refinery was taken down for short time 
In the approach to Spring the market becomes much more sensitive to problems with petrol production as dealers anticipate rising demand for fuel ahead of the holiday season 
The rise in prices came despite US government report that showed domestic supplies of fuel oil and fuel were rising 
Meanwhile oil production cartel Opec's recent announcement that it was now unlikely to cut production levels has also failed to calm fears on the market 
Oil prices are roughly higher than year ago and have risen sharply in recent weeks due to combination of colder weather the declining value of the dollar and fears that Opec could rein in production to head off seasonal drop in demand 
Instability in Iraq and underlying fears about terrorism have also played part in the rally

Japanese industrial output fell in October while unemployment rose casting further doubt on the strength of the country's economic recovery 
Production dropped in October reflecting decline in exports while unemployment levels edged up to slightly higher than forecast 
The economy has grown for six quarters but growth slowed dramatically in the last quarter amid weaker global demand 
Japan's government remains optimistic due to strong domestic demand 
Analysts had been forecasting rise in month on month industrial output 
According to figures from the Ministry of Economy Trade and Industry METI the decline was led by fall in demand for electronic parts for mobile phones and digital televisions 
Although inventories fell month on month they were higher than year ago 
It's sign that the economy's adjustment phase is stronger than expected said Takashi Yamanaka an economist with UFJ Bank 
Japan downgraded its overall economic assessment earlier this month for the first time in year 
Growth slowed to in the quarter ending September down from in the first quarter of 
Experts believe the economy -which stagnated for most of the -may be entering softer patch on the back of rising oil prices and the falling dollar

Less than four years after the new Mini was launched German car maker BMW has announced of new investment 
Some new jobs are to be created at the Oxford factory including modernised machinery and new body shell production building 
The result of the investment could be to raise output to more than cars from 
The rise from last year is response to rapidly-rising demand and could help wipe out waiting lists 
Before Wednesday's announcement BMW had invested some in Mini production 
Since its launch during summer the new Mini has gone from strength to strength 
Last year almost one in six cars sold by the BMW group was Mini 
The company admits that the success of the brand came despite scepticism from many in the industry 
Our decision to produce new Mini was not received well right away said Norbert Reithofer member of the BMW management board 
Initially BMW said it would produce Mini models year at its vast Cowley factory on the outskirts of Oxford but the target was quickly reached then raised time and time again 
Not everyone is convinced that the boom can continue 
The risk is that after they've invested massively in the brand demand tapers off like it did with the new VW Beetle said Brad Wernle from Automotive News Europe 
The price of the car has also gone up 
When it was launched the cheapest Mini cost just more than 
These days buyers will have to fork out almost to own new Mini One or even more for the Cooper which costs up to 
The Mini Convertible which was launched last spring costs up to for the top model and there is even waiting list 
Second-hand Minis are not cheap either 
Mini One bought when the model was launched should still fetch at least for the cheapest model while used Cooper is likely to be priced from according to the-car buying website Parker's 
The consumers' association Which operates with slightly different numbers yet it confirms that the Mini Cooper depreciates slower than any other car other than the Mercedes Benz SE and the BMW Series SE 
The Cowley factory which initially seemed far too large production plant for just Minis is increasingly being put to good use 
There are plans to tear down old buildings and build new ones and there are rumours that new paint shop could be included in the plans 
BMW's Mini adventure has made good much of what went wrong during its stewardship of the UK car maker Rover which it sold for five years ago to the Phoenix consortium 
In when BMW still owned Rover the Oxford factory was producing the award-winning Rover 
During that year people produced cars 
Last year in the same factory almost four times as many vehicles were produced by just Mini-workers 
The Mini factory's current output is equally impressive when compared with the main Rover factory in Longbridge which in produced Rover cars 
Last year MG Rover which employs more than people produced just cars though it hopes to land deal with Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation SAIC that could help double the number of cars produced at Longbridge 
Indeed Mini is not only producing more cars than MG Rover does it remains ahead even when the current sales of Land Rovers and Range Rovers which are made by the former Rover unit that BMW sold to Ford are taken into account

Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi will unveil plans aimed at kickstarting the country's sputtering economy on Thursday night in Rome 
He will present an Action Plan for the Development of Italy in meeting with industrialists and trade union leaders 
Mr Berlusconi is expected to table reforms aimed at boosting research and development spending and the competitiveness of small firms 
Also in focus will be bankruptcy laws and the slow pace of the legal system 
The prime minister is scheduled to start the meeting at GMT 
The government has been accused of underfunding making it harder for Italy to compete with other European nations and leading to brain-drain of the country's brightest talents 
Analysts say that hiring and firing staff is still too difficult and expensive hampering the development of small- and medium-sized businesses 
As result they say Italy's corporate landscape is filled with numerous smaller companies that are often reluctant to become bigger because of all the extra hassle that would accompany the running of larger firm 
At the same time bankruptcy laws make it difficult for failed company directors to set up new businesses and emerge from their debts situation that is hampering Italy's entrepreneurial spirit 
The government says that it has set about tackling the problems adding that getting growth going was the responsibility of all of Italy's million population 
According to Il Sole Ore Italy's business newspaper the government will focus on opening up markets infrastructure research making more incentives available bankruptcy law the slow pace of the justice system 
Mr Berlusconi has previously promised to cut taxes by bn euros bn bn this year in an effort to get people and companies to spend 
He has also promised to cap spending on transport education and health so as to trim the ballooning budget deficit 
Italy plans to raise as much as bn euros from privatisations in including partial flotation of the post office and utility Enel 
Critics argue that these moves do not go far enough and could make Italy's problems worse 
Limiting government spending will lead to job losses they counter while the income tax cuts will have negligible effect on sentiment and ultimately favour the wealthy 
The country has been one of the eurozone's worst economic performers in recent years 
Growth was in up from just in and in an improvement but still long way from ideal 
At the same time business and consumer confidence has dipped and analysts have raised concerns that what little spending there is stems from Italians dipping into their savings accounts or using credit cards 
Without pick up in national growth they say the money could eventually run out bringing Italy's economy to juddering halt 
Consumer spending accounts for about two-thirds of Italy's economy

The UK economy probably grew at faster rate in the third quarter than the reported according to Bank of England deputy governor Rachel Lomax 
Private sector business surveys suggest stronger economy than official estimates Ms Lomax said 
Other surveys collectively show rapid slowdown in UK house price growth she pointed out 
This means that despite strong economic growth base rates will probably stay on hold at 
Official data comes from the Office for National Statistics ONS 
Though reliable ONS data takes longer to publish so now the BoE is calling for faster delivery of data so it can make more effective policy decisions 
Recent work by the Bank has shown that private sector surveys add value even when preliminary ONS estimates are available Ms Lomax said in speech to the North Wales Business Club 
The ONS is due to publish its second estimate of third quarter growth on Friday

The Bank said successful monetary policy depends on having good information 
Rachel Lomax cited the late as an example of time when weak economic figures were published but substantially revised upwards years later 
The statistical fog surrounding the true state of the economy has proved particularly potent breeding ground for policy errors in the past she said 
Improving the quality of national statistics is the single the best way of making sure the Monetary Policy Committee MPC makes the right decisions she said 
The Bank of England is working in tandem with the ONS to improve the quality and speed of delivery of data 
Her remarks follow criticism from the House of Lords Economic Affairs Committee which said the MPC had held interest rates too high given that inflation was way below the target 
slowdown in the housing market and this year's surge in oil prices has made economic forecasting all the more tricky leading to more uncertain outlook 
This year rising oil prices and significant slowdown in the housing market have awoken bad memories of the and Ms Lomax said 
The MPC will be doing well if it can achieve the same stability over the next decade as we have enjoyed over the past years

We are checking if there is action to be taken and in which courts it could be taken

During that time restrictions were put on planes taxiing taking off and landing at Frankfurt's Rhein-Main airport 
The extra time taken by President Bush and his entourage meant that there was knock-on effect that led to significant delays

Any tax would only be implemented after full consultation with the airlines the EU said 
There is thought to be widespread support for the plan tabled by France and Germany following the recent meeting of the world's richest nations from EU ministers 
The issue of poverty in Africa and South Asia has forced itself to the top of the politicial agenda with politicians and campaigners calling for more to be done 
At their meeting in London finance ministers backed plans to write off up to of the debts of some of the world's poorest countries

German business confidence fell in February knocking hopes of speedy recovery in Europe's largest economy 
Munich-based research institute Ifo said that its confidence index fell to in February from in January its first decline in three months 
The study found that the outlook in both the manufacturing and retail sectors had worsened 
Observers had been hoping that more confident business sector would signal that economic activity was picking up 
We're surprised that the Ifo index has taken such knock said DZ bank economist Bernd Weidensteiner 
The main reason is probably that the domestic economy is still weak particularly in the retail trade 
Economy and Labour Minister Wolfgang Clement called the dip in February's Ifo confidence figure very mild decline 
He said that despite the retreat the index remained at relatively high level and that he expected modest economic upswing to continue 
Germany's economy grew last year after shrinking in 
However the economy contracted by during the last three months of mainly due to the reluctance of consumers to spend 
Latest indications are that growth is still proving elusive and Ifo president Hans-Werner Sinn said any improvement in German domestic demand was sluggish 
Exports had kept things going during the first half of but demand for exports was then hit as the value of the euro hit record levels making German products less competitive overseas 
On top of that the unemployment rate has been stuck at close to and manufacturing firms including DaimlerChrysler Siemens and Volkswagen have been negotiating with unions over cost cutting measures 
Analysts said that the Ifo figures and Germany's continuing problems may delay an interest rate rise by the European Central Bank 
Eurozone interest rates are at but comments from senior officials have recently focused on the threat of inflation prompting fears that interest rates may rise

Billions of farmers' livelihoods are at risk from falling commodity prices and protectionism the UN's Food Agriculture Organisation has warned 
Trade barriers and subsidies severely distort the market the FAO report on the State of Agricultural Commodity Markets said 
As result the billion people in the developing world who rely on farming face food insecurity 
The most endangered are those who live in the least-developed countries 
The FAO report said that support for farmers in industrialised nations was equivalent to times the amount provided as aid for agricultural development in poor countries 
The FAO has urged the World Trade Organisation to swiftly conclude negotiations to liberalise trade easing developing countries' access to the world market 
It also criticised the high tariffs imposed by both developed and developing nations 
It recommends that developing countries reduce their own tariffs to encourage trade and take advantage of market liberalisation 
According to the organisation subsidies and high tariffs have strong impact on the trade of products such as cotton and rice 
Global exports of these products are mainly in the hands of the European Union and the US who thanks to subsidies sell them at very low prices 
In fact almost wealthy nations spend more than bn bn bn euros in agricultural subsidies 
The market situation has divided developing nations in two groups the FAO said 
The first group have reasonably diverse range of agricultural products while in the second group agriculture lies largely in the hands of small-scale producers 
For developing countries more than of their export incomes come from the sale of just one product 
These countries are mainly situated in Sub-Saharan Africa Latin America and the Caribbean

India has cleared proposal allowing up to foreign direct investment in its construction sector 
Kamal Nath Commerce and Industry Minister announced the decision in Delhi on Thursday following cabinet meeting 
Analysts say improving India's infrastructure will boost foreign investment in other sectors too 
The Indian government's decision has spread good cheer in the construction sector according to some Indian firms 
spokesman for DLF Builders Dr Vancheshwar told the BBC this will mean better offerings for consumers as well as builders 
He said the firm will benefit from world class strategic partnerships design expertise and technology while consumers will have better choice 

The government proposal states that foreign investment of up to will be allowed on the 'automatic route' in the construction sector on projects including housing hotels resorts hospitals and educational establishments 
The automatic route means that construction companies need only get one set of official approvals and do not need to gain clearance from the Foreign Investment Promotion Board which can be bureaucratic 
The government hopes its new policy will create employment for construction workers and benefit steel and brick-making industries 
Mr Nath also announced plans to allow foreign investors to develop smaller area of any land they acquired 
Foreign investors can enter any construction development area be it to build resorts townships or commercial premises but they will have to construct at least square meters square feet within specific timeframe said Mr Nath without specifying the timeframe 
Previously foreign investors had to develop much larger area discouraging some from entering the Indian market 
This measure is designed to discourage foreign investors from buying and selling land speculatively without developing it 
Anshuman Magazine managing director of CB Richard Ellis an international real estate company told the BBC this was big positive step 

However Chittabrata Majumdar general secretary of the Centre of Indian Trade Unions CITU said allowing FDI in the country is compromising India's own self reliance 
He said No country can develop on the basis of foreign investment alone 
Mr Majumdar also said an assessment should be made as to whether foreign investment is indeed beneficial to the country in terms of employment and money generated or just another way of international companies filling their deep pockets

US aircraft firm Boeing has unveiled its new long-distance plane as it tries to regain its position as the industry's leading manufacturer 
The LR will be capable of flying almost miles non-stop linking cities such as London and Sydney 
Boeing in contrast to European rival Airbus hopes airlines will want to fly smaller aircraft over longer distances 
Airbus which overtook Boeing as the number one civilian planemaker in is focusing on so-called super jumbos 
Analysts are divided over which approach is best and say that this latest tussle between Boeing and Airbus may prove to be defining moment for the airline industry 
Boeing plans to offer twin-engine planes that are able to fly direct to many of the world's airports getting rid of the need for connecting flights 
It is banking on smaller slimmer planes such as the LR and its much-anticipated Dreamliner plane which is set to take to the skies in 
The LR which had its launch delayed by the September attacks in the US is the fifth variation of Boeing's twin-aisle plane 
The company offically rolled-out the new in Seattle at GMT 
Better fuel efficiency from engines made by GE and lighter materials mean that the plane can connect almost any two cities worldwide 
Boeing has the latest variant in very successful line of airplanes and there is no doubt it will continue to be very successful said David Learmount operations and safety editor at industry magazine Flight International 
But the LR is niche player Mr Learmount continued adding that reach was not the only criteria airlines used when picking their aircraft 
Mr Learmount pointed out that the LR has been on the market for couple of years and only had limited success at attracting orders 
He also said that while the plane may be able to fly to Sydney from London in one hit prevailing winds meant that it would have to stop somewhere on the return journey 
For Airbus the future is big it is pinning its hopes on planes that can carry as many as people between large hub airports 
From there passengers would be ferried to their final destinations by smaller planes 
Airbus is also keeping its options open and plans to compete in all the main categories of aircraft 
It has been producing rival to Boeing's line for more than year 
Airbus is now where Boeing was few years ago with its product range said Flight International's Mr Learmount 
Both Boeing and Airbus have been taking orders for their new planes 
Boeing said it expected to sell about of its LR planes over the next years 
It already has orders from Pakistan International Airlines and EVA of Taiwan 
These orders should help underpin the company's profits 
Boeing said earnings during the last three months of dropped by because of costs relating to stopping production of its smallest airliner the and the cancellation of US air force tanker contract

Japanese brewers are increasingly making money from beer-flavoured drinks rather than beer itself 
Beer and spirits are heavily taxed in Japan driving breweries to search for alternatives 
Japan's long economic downturn helped drive the trend as drinkers looked for cheaper opportunities to drown their sorrows 
Now according to Asahi Breweries the market for so-called beer-like drinks is set to grow this year 
Asahi is predicting profits to rise in as it launches drink based on soybean peptides rather than malt 
The chosen name Shinnama or new draft disguises its non-beer nature 
But despite record profit in of bn yen up on the previous year Asahi is coming late to the market 
Key rival Sapporo is already well-established with the beer-flavoured Draft One 
Suntory meanwhile is doing well with Super Blue which combines happoshu an existing low-cost beer alternative made with malt and seawater and shochu distilled alcohol derived from sweet potatoes or barley 
Happoshu has been mainstay of brewery profits for years taking over from beer thanks to its low tax and therefore low cost

South Korea looks set to sustain its revival thanks to renewed private consumption its central bank says 
The country's economy has suffered from an overhang of personal debt after its consumers' credit card spending spree 
Card use fell sharply last year but is now picking up again with rise in spending of year-on-year

Iran's parliament voted by large majority to cut Turkcell's stake in new mobile network from to 
The move which was justified on national security grounds follows an earlier vote by MPs to give themselves veto over foreign investments 
Turkcell said the decision increases the risks attached to the project

Despite short-lived increase in Palestinian jobs in the economy is performing well below its potential said World Bank report 
Unemployment stood at compared with before the uprising against Israeli occupation four years ago 
Young people are particularly hard hit with out of work compared with four years ago 
But new jobs were created last year during brief easing of violence and closures 
However during the first half of this year the Palestinian economy lost more than jobs 
Last year's growth rate of can also be attributed to this temporary gap in violence the report said 
According to the report Intifada Closures and Palestinian Economic Crisis An Assessment there is close link between the number of closures both border closures and internal closures between cities and Palestinian economic problems 
The closures arranged by Israel restrict the movement of Palestinian people and goods slowing down trade 
Closures are key factor behind today's economic crisis in the West Bank said Nigel Roberts World Bank country director for the West Bank and Gaza 
Nearly half of all Palestinians some live below the poverty line and are particularly vulnerable to economic shocks

China lent Russia bn bn to help the Russian government renationalise the key Yuganskneftegas unit of oil group Yukos it has been revealed 
The Kremlin said on Tuesday that the bn which Russian state bank VEB lent state-owned Rosneft to help buy Yugansk in turn came from Chinese banks 
The revelation came as the Russian government said Rosneft had signed long-term oil supply deal with China 
The deal sees Rosneft receive bn in credits from China's CNPC 
According to Russian newspaper Vedomosti these credits would be used to pay off the loans Rosneft received to finance the purchase of Yugansk 
Reports said CNPC had been offered of Yugansk in return for providing finance but the company opted for long-term oil supply deal instead 
Analysts said one factor that might have influenced the Chinese decision was the possibility of litigation from Yukos Yugansk's former owner if CNPC had become shareholder 
Rosneft and VEB declined to comment 
The two companies Rosneft and CNPC have agreed on the pre-payment for long-term deliveries said Russian oil official Sergei Oganesyan 
There is nothing unusual that the pre-payment is for five to six years 

The announcements help to explain how Rosneft medium-sized indebted and relatively unknown firm was able to finance its surprise purchase of Yugansk 
Yugansk was sold for bn in an auction last year to help Yukos pay off part of bn bill in unpaid taxes and fines 
The embattled Russian oil giant had previously filed for bankruptcy protection in US court in an attempt to prevent the forced sale of its main production arm 
But Yugansk was sold to little known shell company which in turn was bought by Rosneft 
Yukos claims its downfall was punishment for the political ambitions of its founder Mikhail Khodorkovsky 
Once the country's richest man Mr Khodorkovsky is on trial for fraud and tax evasion 
The deal between Rosneft and CNPC is seen as part of China's desire to secure long-term oil supplies to feed its booming economy 
China's thirst for products such as crude oil copper and steel has helped pushed global commodity prices to record levels 
Clearly the Chinese are trying to get some leverage in Russia said Dmitry Lukashov an analyst at brokerage Aton 
They understand property rights in Russia are not the most important rights and they are more interested in guaranteeing supplies 
If the price of oil is fixed under the deal which is unlikely it could be very profitable for the Chinese Mr Lukashov continued 
And Rosneft is in desperate need of cash so it's good deal for them too

Russian oil firm Yukos lied to US court in an attempt to stop the Russian government selling off its key production unit the court has heard 
The unit Yugansk was sold to pay off bn bn back tax bill 
Yukos argued that since it had US subsidiary and local bank accounts the US court could declare it bankrupt and stop the auction of Yugansk 
But Deutsche Bank itself target of Yukos lawsuit said documents had been backdated to strengthen the case 
Deutsche Bank's evidence came on the first day of two-day hearing in Houston 
Its lawyer Hugh Ray told the court that Yukos had claimed it had transferred into two Texas bank accounts opened by its new US subsidiary 
By doing so he said the firm had intended to reinforce its US presence and thus its chances of getting its case heard in US courts 
But he said that the papers documenting the transaction were not drawn up till weeks after Yukos made its bankruptcy application on December and then backdated 
Yukos chief financial officer Bruce Misamore who had moved to the US in early December to set up Yukos USA acknowledged the point 
He said the discrepancy was only in the paperwork but that money had indeed been transferred on December 
Even so he told the court that only had been in the accounts that day with the rest arriving day later 
Deutsche Bank is involved in the case because it is itself being sued by Yukos 
It had agreed to loan to an arm of Russian state gas firm Gazprom the money to bid for Yuganskneftegaz as the Yukos unit is formally known 
The sale went ahead despite an order from the US bankruptcy court ordered that it should be stopped 
In the end the auction was won by an unknown shell company for bn much less than most assessments of its value before ending up in the hands of state-controlled oil firm Rosneft 
Rosneft meanwhile has agreed to merge with Gazprom bringing large chunk of Russia's very profitable oil business back under state control 
Yukos maintains that it filed for bankruptcy in the US because it feared it would not be able to do so in Russia 
It also said that in the event of going bust it could offer the chance of restructuring 
It gives us kind of life after death alternative said Yukos chief executive Steven Theede 
Yukos is currently suing four companies Gazprom its unit Gazpromneft Rosneft and the shell company which won the bidding for their part in Yugansk's disposal

For Metlife the US's leading insurance company the purchase gives it access to much larger distribution network 
Robert Benmosche Metlife's chairman and chief executive said that it was great opportunity for the brand of Metlife to be distributed through Citigroup 
Under the agreement Metlife will be able to sell its products through Citigroup over the next years 
The deal includes Smith Barney retail brokerages and Citibank branches 
The company will pay between bn and bn in Metlife stock with the rest being made up of cash 
Travelers had sales of bn in and made profit of 
It has total net assets of bn 
This deal employs some of Metlife's excess capital in potentially higher-return business and gives it more distribution said Stuart Quint an analyst at Gartmore

European leaders have openly blamed the US for the sharp rise in the value of the euro 
US officials were talking up the dollar they said but failing to take action to back up their words 
Meeting in Brussels finance ministers of the eurozone countries voiced their concern that the rise of the european currency was harming exports 
The dollar is within touching distance of an all-time low reached earlier in November 
At GMT on Tuesday the dollar was up slightly at just above to the euro and buying yen in Tokyo 
It rallied briefly on Monday amid signs that oil prices are easing 
But analysts said the respite was likely to be only temporary 
The European ministers' comments said Junya Tanase of JPMorgan Chase bank in Tokyo were generally too weak to produce market reaction 
Still by the standards of diplomacy the European ministers were forthright 
Nicolas Sarkozy of France said he and his colleagues were unanimous in their worry that the decline of the dollar would hit Europe's economies by eating into their exports 
We are concerned about these developments which are destabilising and which are linked to the accumulation of deficits by our American friends he said 
The comments come day after US Treasury Secretary John Snow said strong dollar was in America's interest 
But that was not enough for Mr Sarkozy 
If the Americans were to change their policy it's up to them to say so he said 
And the European Union's monetary affairs commissioner made it clear that action was necessary 
fully welcome the words of Mr Snow said Joaquin Almunia but we will need to see decisions adopted in that direction 
If the imbalances in the US economy are not adjusted in the future the decision in the market will be as in the past weeks 
Economists point out that whatever Europe says in the short term weaker dollar is boon to President George Bush's administration 
Not only does it boost US exports but it also makes the budget deficit easier to fund 
On the other hand slower European exports would mean slower EU growth potentially reducing the demand for US goods

The French government is to hand its struggling wine industry euros in aid to help it battle falling sales and damaging overproduction 
The financial package is aimed at assisting vintners in financial trouble and improving how its wine is marketed 
The French wine industry the world's second largest has been hit by declining consumption at home and the growing popularity of New World wines 
Wine makers however claimed the support did not go far enough 
The package was announced by agriculture minister Dominique Bussereau after talks with vintners' representatives 
The bulk of the money about euros will be offered in the form of preferential loans to heavily indebted producers to enable them to reschedule their payments 
further euros will be made available to wine cooperatives which make up the majority of French producers in low interest loans 
Efforts to promote French wine abroad are to be boosted by an extra euros in funding 
France fell behind the 'New World' producers of Australia Chile and the United States for the first time in in terms of exports 
Domestic consumption accounting for of sales has suffered from strict restrictions on advertising and tough drink-driving laws 
The aid package would create positive climate around French viticulture Mr Bussereau said 
However wine makers and farmers said the support was much less than they had been hoping for 
am afraid the resources are not up to the ambitions Jean-Michel Lemetayer from the FNSEA agricultural union told the Associated Press news agency 
In an effort to tackle overcapacity the government will agree that vines can be destroyed in areas where growers give their unanimous consent while vintners will be helped to take early retirement 
The government will also seek European Union approval to distil about million litres of excess wine into alcohol with vintners receiving compensation 
Production is currently outstripping demand by about 
The support is designed to make French producers more competitive in the face of increasing global consolidation across the wine industry 
Wine makers in France's best-known regions such as Burgundy have found it hard to invest in new technology and to create recognisable brands to appeal to overseas buyers

Soaring oil sales and budget surplus mean Russian debt is no longer risky investment one of the world's leading credit rating agencies says 
Standard Poor's has classed Russian bonds as investment grade up from their former speculative rating 
Russia's reputation among investors has been hurt in recent months by the heavy tax bills and asset seizures imposed on companies such as oil giant Yukos 
said the solidity of government finances outweighed the risk 
Russia is now net creditor rather than debtor 
Gold and foreign currency reserves of bn beat its foreign public debt of some bn 
The other two major ratings agencies Fitch and Moody's have long since upped their rating of Russia's sovereign debt 
had held back through fear that the government was dragging its feet on economic and legal reforms 
Now though it has finally followed suit 
But the agency made it clear that the improved rating did not mean that the risks were thing of the past 
Instead with Russian government coffers brimming with tax revenues from energy sales said the government's own debt is looking good bet 
These improvements are so significant that they now outweight the serious and growing political risk that continues to be key ratings constraint on Russia wrote credit analyst Helena Hessel 
The Yukos saga is the most high-profile of the political risks to which Ms Hessel alludes 
The company's founder and ex-chief executive Mikhail Khodorkovsky is in jail on trial for tax evasion and fraud 
Many believe the real motive for his prosecution is that he threatened to use his wealth to set up political alternative to President Vladimir Putin 
His company meanwhile is widely believed to have fallen victim to the Kremlin's wish to get Russian energy resources as far as possible back under state control

Turkey's biggest private mobile firm could bail out of bn bn deal to build network in Iran after MPs there slashed its stake in the project 
Conservatives in parliament say Turkcell's stake in Irancell the new network should be cut from to 
They have already given themselves veto over all foreign investment deals following allegations about Turkish firms' involvement in Israel 
Turkcell now says it may give up on the deal altogether 
Iran currently has only one heavily congested mobile network with long waiting lists for new subscribers 
Turkcell signed contract for the new network in September 
The new operator planned to offer subscriptions for about well below the existing firm's price tag 
But parliamentary commission has now ruled that Turkcell's controlling stake is too high 
They say that Turkcell is security risk because of alleged business ties with Israel 
Parliament as whole dominated by religious conservatives will vote on the ruling on Tuesday 
Turkcell said the ruling would make more difficult 
Turkcell's financial consolidation of Irancell because its stake would be reduced to less than 
If management control and financial consolidation of Irancell cannot be achieved

Argentina is set to close its bn bn debt restructuring offer for bondholders later on Friday with the government hopeful that most creditors will accept the deal 
The estimated loss to bondholders is up to of the original value of the bonds yet the majority are expected to accept the government's offer 
Argentina defaulted on its debt three years ago the biggest sovereign default in modern history 
Yesterday Argentina's economy minister Roberto Lavagna said that he estimated that the results of the restructuring would be ready around next Thursday March 
Argentina's President Nestor Kirchner said on Friday year ago when we started the swap negotiations they told us we were crazy that we were irrational 
But he added that his government was close to achieving The best debt renegotiation in history 
The country has been in default on the bn based on an original debt of bn plus interest for the past three years 
If the offer does not go ahead international lawsuits on behalf of aggrieved investors could follow but analysts are optimistic that it will go through despite the tough terms for bondholders 
About to of bondholders are expected to accept the terms of the offer 
By February creditors holding bn or of the total debt had accepted the offer 
Sorting out its debt would enhance the country's credibility on international markets and enable it to attract more foreign investment 
Of Argentina's bondholders reside in Argentina in Italy in Switzerland in the United States in Germany and in Japan 
Investors in the UK Holland and Luxembourg have about each and the remainder were not broken down by country 
The deal is likely to be taken up most enthusiastically by domestic investors who will benefit if Argentina's economy becomes more stable

The US dollar's slide against the euro and yen has halted after US Treasury Secretary John Snow said strong dollar was in America's interest 
But analysts said any gains are likely to be short-lived as problems with the US economy were still significant 
They also pointed out that positive comments apart President George Bush's administration had done little to stop the dollar's slide 
weak dollar helps boost exports and narrow the current account deficit 
The dollar was trading at against the euro at GMT still close to the record level set on November 
Against the Japanese yen it was trading at yen after hitting seven-month low of earlier in the day 
Policy makers in Europe have called the dollar's slide brutal and have blamed the strength of the euro for dampening economic growth 
However it is unclear whether ministers would issue declaration aimed at curbing the euro's rise at monthly meeting of Eurozone ministers late on Monday 
Higher growth in Europe is regarded by US officials as way the huge US current account deficit that has been weighing on the dollar could be reduced 
Mr Snow who is currently in Dublin at the start of four-nation EU visit has applauded Ireland's introduction of lower taxes and deregulation which have helped boost growth 
The eurozone is growing below its potential 
When major part of the global economy is below potential there are negative consequences 
for the citizens of those economies

US officials have also said that other economies need to grow so the US is not the main global growth engine

The Reserve Bank of Australia lifted interest rates to their first upwards move in more than year 
However shortly after the Bank made its decision new figures showed fall in economic growth in the last quarter 
The Bank said it had acted to curb inflation but the move was criticised by some analysts 
The rate hike was the first since December and had been well-flagged in advance 
However opposition parties and some analysts said the move was ill-timed given data showing the Australian economy grew just between October and December and on an annual basis 
The figures representing decline from the growth in GDP seen between July and September were below market expectations 
Consumer spending remains strong however and the Bank is concerned about growing inflationary pressures 
Over recent months it has become increasingly clear that remaining spare capacity in the labour and goods markets is becoming rather limited said Ian Macfarlane Governor of the Reserve Bank

The US Justice Department is to try to overturn court ruling that threw out its claim for bn bn in damages from tobacco firms 
Earlier this month three-judge appeal court panel rejected the claim filed in by the administration of Bill Clinton in decision 
Government lawyers said they would ask the full US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia to hear the case 
The court room battle is seen as key in government attempts to fight smoking 
It's pretty clear that they've suffered severe setback said Anthony Sebok professor at Brooklyn Law School adding that the appeal was what the government would be expected to ask for 
Prosecutors had argued that tobacco firms lied about the dangers of smoking ignored research that highlighted problems looked to increase addiction by manipulating nicotine levels and targeted the young with their adverts 
Among the firms accused were Altria Group RJ Reynolds Tobacco Lorillard Tobacco Liggett Group and Brown and Williamson 
Prosecutors went after the companies using legislation put in place to fight organised crime and accused the firms of conspiring and running Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organisations 
The tobacco companies denied the charges saying that they never illegally conspired to promote smoking and fool the public 
They also said that they have met many of the government's demands laid out in landmark bn settlement hammered out in with states 
three-judge panel agreed with the companies finding that the case could not be brought under federal anti-racketeering laws 
Central to the government's case was meeting in the Plaza Hotel New York on December 
Prosecutors contend that executives from the major tobacco firms met and agreed to present unified strategy denying the harmful effects of smoking 
Despite denying for decades that smoking could be linked to illness the companies have modified their stances in recent years 
Altria's Philip Morris now accepts that nicotine is harmful and the company's main lawyer William Ohlemeyer told the BBC last year that earlier statements may have been wrong but they were not dishonest

Chancellor Gordon Brown will meet his golden economic rule with margin to spare according to his former chief economic adviser 
Formerly one of Mr Brown's closest Treasury aides Ed Balls hinted at Budget giveaway on March 
He said he hoped more would be done to build on current tax credit rules 
Any rate rise ahead of an expected May election would not affect the Labour Party's chances of winning he added 
Last July Mr Balls won the right to step down from his Treasury position and run for parliament defending the Labour stronghold of Normanton in West Yorkshire 
Mr Balls rejected the allegation that Mr Brown had been sidelined in the election campaign saying he was playing different role to the one he played in the last two elections 
He rejected speculation that Mr Brown was considering becoming Foreign Secretary saying his recent travels had been linked to efforts to boost international development 
Gordon Brown's decision to announce the date of the Budget while on trip to China was sensible thing to do since he was talking about skills and investment at the time Mr Balls told the BBC 
Commenting on speculation of an interest rate rise he said it was not within the remit of the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee MPC to factor potential election into its rate decisions 
Expectations of rate rise have gathered pace after figures showed that house prices are still rising 
Consumer borrowing rose at near-record pace in January

One result was deflation prices falling rather than rising which made Japanese shoppers cautious and kept them from spending 
The effect was to leave the economy more dependent than ever on exports for its recent recovery 
But high oil prices have knocked off the growth rate while the falling dollar means products shipped to the US are becoming relatively more expensive 
The performance for the third quarter marks sharp downturn from earlier in the year 
The first quarter showed annual growth of with the second showing and economists had been predicting as much as this time around 
Exports slowed while capital spending became weaker said Hiromichi Shirakawa chief economist at UBS Securities in Tokyo 
Personal consumption looks good but it was mainly due to temporary factors such as the Olympics 
The amber light is flashing 
The government may now find it more difficult to raise taxes policy it will have to implement when the economy picks up to help deal with Japan's massive public debt

We let range of targets limit our ability flexibility and did not adjust our plans quickly enough to more difficult business environment 
Our objective is to reverse the share loss that we experienced in some markets in and return to growth

The European Commission has written to the mobile phone operators Vodafone and T-Mobile to challenge the high rates they charge for international roaming 
In letters sent to the two companies the Commission alleged the firms were abusing their dominant market position in the German mobile phone market 
It is the second time Vodafone has come under the Commission's scrutiny 
The UK operator is already appealing against allegations that its UK roaming rates are unfair and excessive 
Vodafone's response to the Commission's letter was defiant 
We believe the roaming market is competitive and we expect to resist the charges said Vodafone spokesman 
However we will need time to examine the statement of objections in detail before we formally respond 

The Commission's investigation into Vodafone and Deutsche Telekom's T-Mobile centres on the tariffs the two companies charge foreign mobile operators to access their networks when subscribers of those foreign operators use their mobile phones in Germany 
The Commission believes these wholesale prices are too high and that the excess is passed on to consumers 
The Commission aims to ensure that European consumers are not overcharged when they use their mobile phones on their travels around the European Union the Commission said in statement 
Vodafone and Britain's other big mobile phone operator were sent similar statements of objections by the Commission in July last year 
Vodafone sent the Commission response to those allegations in December last year and is now waiting for reply 
The Vodafone spokesman said similar process would be set in motion with these latest statement of objections about its operations in Germany 
The companies will have three months to respond to the Commission's allegations and the process may go on for some time yet the spokesman said 
The Commission could charge the companies up to of their annual turnover though in practice that sort of figure is rarely demanded 
The Commission's latest move comes just few months after national telecoms regulators across Europe launched joint investigation which could lead to people being charged less for using their mobile phone when travelling abroad 
The investigation involves regulators assessing whether there is effective competition in the roaming market

The Bank of England has left interest rates on hold at for sixth month in row 
The Bank's Monetary Policy Committee MPC decided to take no action amid mixed signals from the economy 
But some economists predict further rise in the cost of borrowing will come later this year 
Interest rates rose five times between November and August as soaring house prices and buoyant consumer data sparked inflation fears 
Bank of England governor Mervyn King has recently warned against placing too much weight on one month's economic data suggesting the MPC is waiting for clearer picture to emerge 
Economists see next week's inflation report from the MPC as key in assessing whether further interest rate rise is necessary to keep the economy in check 
Slower consumer spending and quieter housing market are likely to have convinced the MPC that rates should be left unchanged in recent months 
Inflation however has been rising faster than expected hitting an annual rate of in December its highest level in six months 
Data on Wednesday also showed manufacturing output rose at its fastest rate since May last month reinforcing view that economic growth was stronger than forecasts 
And recent house surveys from the Halifax and Nationwide have indicated prices are still rising albeit at slower pace than in recent years 
Philip Shaw chief economist at Investec Securities said he believed rates would remain at for the rest of the year although strong economic data could lead to further hike 
The economic landscape has changed quite considerably over the last couple of months he said 
Growth appears stronger and the MPC may become more concerned about inflation trends 
Howard Archer economist at Global Insight said the MPC may well consider that the balance of risks to the growth and inflation outlook have moved from the downside to the upside 
Business groups welcomed the MPC's widely-expected move to leave rates on hold and cautioned against further rises 
The British Chambers of Commerce BCC said it was concerned by the clamour in some quarters for early interest rate increases 
We believe that these demands should be firmly resisted said David Frost BCC director general 
Manufacturing still faces extremely serious problems and is performing poorly in spite of the recent revised figures 
Ian McCafferty chief economist at the CBI said the MPC faced an interesting challenge 
Consumers appear to have pulled in their horns over the holiday period and exporters are struggling with the strength of sterling he said 
However the broader economy continues to show healthy growth and the tight labour market and buoyant commodity prices are nudging inflation higher

However some farmers are sceptical about the proposals 
People who are not farming will hijack the subsidy said Joshua Osagie cocoa farmer from Edo state told Reuters 
The farmers in the village never see any assistance he added 
At the same time as Nigeria announced its new initiative Ghana the world's second largest cocoa exporter announced revenues from the industry had broken new records 
The country saw more than bn-worth of the beans exported during

US interest rates are to rise for the fourth time in five months in widely anticipated move 
The Federal Reserve has raised its key federal funds rate by quarter percentage point to in light of mounting evidence that the US economy is regaining steam 
US companies created twice as many jobs as expected in October while exports hit record levels in September

Another rise could be in store for December some economists warned

The Fed has been gradually easing rates up since the summer with quarter percentage point rises in June August and September

The majority owner of embattled Russian oil firm Yukos has sued the Russian government for bn bn 
The Kremlin last year seized and sold Yukos' main production arm Yugansk to state-run oil group Rosneft for bn to offset massive back tax bill 
Group Menatep the Gibraltar-based holding company which controls of Yukos says this was illegal 
Menatep has already asked Rosneft to repay loan that Yugansk had secured on its assets 
The Russian government's argument for selling Yuganskneftegaz the unit's full name was that Yukos owed more than bn in back taxes for the years from onwards 
It accused the firm of using web of offshore firms to avoid its tax liabilities and the courts sent in bailiffs to freeze Yukos accounts and seize Yugansk 
But critics say the sell-off and the assault on Yukos' finances are part of an attempt to bring the energy industry back under state control 
According to Menatep the government's actions were contrary to the Energy Charter Treaty which was designed to regulate disagreements over energy investments 
We have warned the Russian government about their continuing attacks against Yukos its personnel and its shareholders and we have warned any buyer of Yuganskneftegaz that they would face lifetime of litigation said Tim Osborne director of Group Menatep 
The time for warning is over and actions to recover the value of our losses begin in earnest today 

Menatep said the value of its Yukos shareholding had gone from bn to virtually nothing since as result of the Russian government's action as its shares have fallen 
According to its Paris lawyer Emmanuel Gaillard of Shearman and Sterling the overall claim is based on that figure with addition for the share gains that could have accrued since then 
Arbitration of the lawsuit could take place in Stockholm or The Hague Mr Gaillard said 
While Russia has signed the Charter it has never ratified it which some experts say could make it difficult for Menatep to press its case 
But Mr Gaillard told BBC News that the Charter came into effect on signature not ratification 
Russia has said in the past that it is bound by it so as to attract foreign investors he said 
Yukos is still waiting to see what will happen to its filing in US court for bankruptcy protection 
It took the action to try to prevent the forced sale of Yugansk first to little-known shell company which in turn was bought by Rosneft 
Yukos claims its downfall was punishment for the political ambitions of its founder Mikhail Khodorkovsky 
Mr Khodorkovsky currently facing fraud and tax evasion charges of his own was one of the founders of Menatep 
He has since signed over his shareholding to one of his fellow investors

The merger of Russian gas giant Gazprom and oil firm Rosneft is to go ahead but will not include Yugansk which was controversially bought last year 
The merger backed by Russian authorities will allow foreigners to trade in Gazprom shares 
Gazprom chief Alexei Miller confirmed Rosneft-owned Yugansk was not part of the deal and will instead be spun off 
Under the agreement the state will get controlling share of Gazprom in exchange for Rosneft 
The state wanted to control Gazprom before allowing foreigners to trade 
Speaking on NTV television which is controlled by Gazprom Mr Miller added that Yugansk which was swallowed up by Rosneft late last year will operate as separate state-owned oil firm headed by current Rosneft chief Sergei Bogdanchikov 
According to reports from Russian News Agency Interfax the deal should go through in the next two to three months 
Obtaining majority control over Gazprom is the beginning of the liberalisation of the market in Gazprom shares Mr Miller added 
By opening up trading in Gazprom to foreigners the firm will become top emerging market play for traders 
Currently foreigners can only trade in Gazprom via small issue of London-listed proxy shares 
This is positive news for the international investment community Global Asset Management investment chief David Smith said 
The majority of investors are going to be happy he added 
However analysts were disappointed that Yugansk would not be included in the deal 
Yugansk is heavy cashflow generator and would have been much better asset for Gazprom Renaissance Capital energy analyst Adam Landes told Reuters news agency 
But he said the latest development was simply an interim step to allow foreigners to trade in Gazprom 
Ultimately and industrially Gazprom needs Yugansk he added 
Analysts said the deal would give Gazprom control of of Russia's total oil production an improvement on its current but still far less than the share it would have gained had it also taken over Yugansk 
However the merged group will still remain outside Russia's top five oil producers led by Lukoil with of the market followed by TNK-BP which is half owned by BP and Surgutneftegaz

Yugansk was sold to little-known shell company in disputed auction in December following what many thought was politically-motivated attack on Yukos 
The shell company was then snapped up by Rosneft 
Yukos unsuccessfully sought to halt the auction by applying for bankruptcy through the US courts

Cameroon says widespread corruption in its finance ministry has cost it bn CFA francs month 
About officials are accused of either awarding themselves extra money or claiming salaries for non-existent workers 
Prime Minister Ephraim Inoni who vowed to tackle corruption when he came to office last year said those found guilty would face tough punishments 
The scam is believed to have begun in 
The prime minister's office said the alleged fraud was uncovered during an investigation into the payroll at the ministry 
In certain cases staff are said to have lied about their rank and delayed their retirement in order to boost their earnings 
The prime minister's office said auditors had found irregularities in the career structure of certain civil servants 
It added that the staff in question appear to have received unearned salaries boosting the payroll 
Fidelis Nanga journalist based in the Cameroon capital Yaounde said the government was considering taking criminal action against those found guilty and forcing them to repay any money owed 
The prime minister has given instructions for exemplary penalties to be meted out against the accused and their accomplices if found guilty he told the BBC's Network Africa programme 
Mr Inoni launched an anti-corruption drive in December after foreign investors criticised lack of transparency in the country's public finances 
In one initiative designed to improve efficiency civil servants who arrived late for work were locked out of their offices 
The government now intends to carry out an audit of payrolls at all other government ministries

The US economy added jobs in October seven-month high and far more than Wall Street expectations 
In welcome economic boost for newly re-elected President George Bush the Labor Department figures come after slow summer of weak jobs gains 
Jobs were created in every sector of the US economy except manufacturing 
While the separate unemployment rate went up to from in September this was because more people were now actively seeking work 
The new jobs added to US payrolls in October was twice the figure that Wall Street economists had forecast 
In addition the Labor Department revised up the number of jobs created in the two previous months to in September instead of and to in August instead of 
The better than expected jobs data had an immediate upward effect on stocks in New York with the main Dow Jones index gaining points to by late morning trading 
It looks like the job situation is improving and that this will support consumer spending going into the holidays and offset some of the drag caused by high oil prices this year said economist Gary Thayer of AG Edwards Sons 
Other analysts said the upbeat jobs data made it more likely that the US Federal Reserve would increase interest rates by quarter of percentage point to when it meets next week 
It should empower the Fed to clearly do something said Robert MacIntosh chief economist with Eaton Vance Management in Boston 
Kathleen Utgoff commissioner of the Bureau of Labor said many of the new construction jobs added in October were involved in rebuilding and clean-up work in Florida and neighbouring Deep South states following four hurricanes in August and September 
The dollar rose temporarily on the job creation news before falling back to new record low against the euro as investors returned their attention to other economic factors such as the US's record trade deficit 
There is also speculation that President Bush will deliberately try to keep the dollar low in order to assist growth in exports

row over whether only Greece should be allowed to label its cheese feta has reached the European Court of Justice 
The Danish and German governments are challenging European Commission ruling which said Greece should have sole rights to use the name 
The Commission's decision gave the same legal protection to feta as to Italian Parma ham and French Champagne 
But critics of the judgement say feta is generic term with the cheese produced widely outside Greece 
The Commission's controversial ruling gave protected designation of origin status to feta cheese made in Greece effectively restricting the use of the feta name to producers there 
From onwards Greek firms will have the exclusive use of the feta label and producers elsewhere in Europe must find another name to describe their products 
The German and Danish governments argue that feta does not relate to specific geographical area and that their firms have been producing and exporting the cheese for years 
In our opinion it is generic designation and we do not have any other name or term for this type of cheese Hans Arne Kristiansen spokesman for the Danish Dairy Board told the BBC 
Denmark is Europe's second largest producer of feta after Greece producing about tonnes year and exports its products to Greece 
It is concerned that the ruling could threaten the production of other cheeses in Denmark such as brie 
It would cost millions if we wanted to introduce new designation Mr Kristiansen said 
That is just one of the costs 

The case will also have major impact on Britain's sole feta producer Yorkshire company Shepherds Purse Cheeses 
Judy Bell the company's founder said it would cost huge amount to rebrand its product 
If we lose we will have to go through massive re-merchandising process and reorganisation she said 
We have never tried to pull the wool over anyone's eyes it's very clear from the label that it's Yorkshire feta 
The original decision was victory for Greece where feta cheese is believed to have been produced for about years 
Feta is soft white cheese made from sheep or goat's milk and is an essential ingredient in Greek cuisine 
Greece makes tonnes mainly for domestic consumption 
The Court is expected to reach verdict in the case in the autumn

Ukraine is preparing what could be wholesale review of the privatisation of thousands of businesses by the previous administration 
The new President Viktor Yushchenko has said limited list of companies is being drawn up 
But on Wednesday Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko said the government was planning to renationalise firms 
The government says many privatised firms were sold to allies of the last administration at rock-bottom prices 
More than businesses in all from massive corporations to tiny shopfronts have been sold off since as the command economy built up when Ukraine was part of the Soviet Union was dismantled 
Ms Tymoshenko said prosecutors had drawn up list of more than businesses which were to be reviewed 
We will return to the state that which was illegally put into private hands 

day earlier Mr Yushchenko keen to reassure potential investors had said only to top firms would be targeted 
The list will be limited and final and will not be extended after its completion he said 
An open-ended list could further damage outside investors' fragile faith in Ukraine said Stuart Hensel of the Economist Intelligence Unit 
But the government seemed keen not to make the review look like the kind of wholesale renationalisation which many fear in Russia Mr Hensel said 
As result it was planning to resell rather than keep firms in state hands 
They're aware of the need not to scare investors and to be careful of internal divides within Ukraine he said 
They don't want to be seen to be transferring assets from one set of oligarchs to new set 
Foreign investment in Ukraine at about head in is one of the lowest among ex-Soviet states 
Mr Yushchenko became president after two elections in December the first of which was annulled amid allegations of voting irregularities and massive street protests 
His opponent Viktor Yanukovich still has huge support in the country's eastern industrial heartland 
Mr Yushchenko's administration has accused its predecessor led by ex-President Leonid Kuchma of corruption 
The privatisation review's number one target is steel mill sold to consortium which included Viktor Pinchuk Mr Kuchma's son-in-law for despite higher bids from several foreign groups 
The mill Krivorizhstal is one of the world's most profitable 
We say Krivorizhstal was stolen and at any cost we will return it to the state Mr Yushchenko told an investors' conference in Kiev 
One of the jilted bidders Netherlands-based group LNM said it welcomed the possibility that the mill might be back on the market 
If the original privatisation is annulled and new tender issued then we would look at it with great interest spokesman told BBC News 
resale of Krivorizhstal could potentially triple the price according to the Economist Intelligence Unit's Mr Hensel 
But he warned that the government could decide to take the easy route of revaluing the company and charging the existing owners the revised price rather than undertaking fresh sale 
That way Mr Yushchenko can go to the public and say he has forced the oligarchs to play by the rules he told BBC News

The German government is trying to tackle the stubbornly-high levels of joblessness with range of labour market reforms 
At their centre is the Hartz-IV programme introduced in January to shake up welfare benefits and push people back into work even if some of the jobs are heavily subsidised

Mr Schroeder had originally come into office promising to halve unemployment

Adjusted for seasonal changes the overall unemployment rate is million people or up percentage points from the previous month 
Using the most internationally-accepted methodology of the International Labour Organisation ILO Germany had million people out of work in January 
And ILO-based figures also suggest that new net jobs were created that month taking the number of people employed to million

The economic targets set out at the Lisbon summit of European Union leaders in were meant to help Europe leapfrog its way past the United States to become the world's leading economy by 
But the Lisbon targets are about much more than just economic prestige 
For many economists and analysts they are about ensuring Europe doesn't become global economic laggard 
They are also about ensuring Europe can continue to compete as an equal with the growing economic giants of Asia India and China as well as with the economic might of the United States 
That's why there was tone of urgency in the report out on Wednesday by the former Dutch prime minister Wim Kok 
Mr Kok was commissioned by the European Commission in March this year to assess how far the EU has come towards meeting the Lisbon targets five years on from their inception 
His conclusion was simple too many of the targets will be seriously missed 
Lisbon risks becoming synonym for missed objectives and failed promises his report said 
The status quo is not an option 

At risk in the medium to long run is nothing less than the sustainability of the society Europe has built it said 
The report comes at time when Europe's competitive position is waning 
The EU's economic growth rate is projected to be this year and next 
While there has been growth in overall employment rates in Europe productivity lags behind that of the US 
But meeting the Lisbon targets requires political commitment that no EU member state has volunteered so far 
That has in part been due to the state of the global economy in the past few years 
As Mr Kok's report noted The ink had scarcely dried on the Lisbon agreement before the worldwide stock market bubble imploded 
The US suffered two years of economic slowdown and recession and the European economy followed suit 

The circumstances weren't conducive to creating the million new jobs promised by EU leaders in Lisbon in 
Neither were they conducive to getting governments to spend more on research and development money needed if the EU was to meet its target of becoming so-called knowledge-based economy 
The Lisbon vision is compelling one but in order to do it society has to change said Paul Hofheinz of the Lisbon Council Brussels-based citizen action group 
What you find is that lot of people have been fighting change 
You find trade unions fighting change 
But also the employers' associations 
Even though they tell you they're in favour of change many are actually pushing for less competition more subsidy and less free market activity 

But part of the problem was also linked to the original targets set out in Lisbon five years ago 
Targets have habit of coming back to haunt you and in the Lisbon case they covered too much according to the Wim report 
Economic growth and job creation were linked to issues ranging from environmental protection to social inclusion and even safety at sea 
The agenda was just too broad and as result nothing was prioritised 
Lisbon is about everything and thus about nothing the Kok report said 
Everybody is responsible and thus no one 
That's why the Kok report recommends that the Lisbon targets be narrowed down to key indicators with an emphasis on creating jobs and economic growth 
It also recommends that the European Commission draw up league table which ranks countries according to the steps they're taking towards meeting the targets effectively naming shaming and faming 
Rhetoric and delivery don't necessarily go hand in hand Mr Kok said in press conference alongside the publication of his report 
We don't have the luxury anymore just to exchange politeness with one another 

On one point Mr Kok was very clear The European Union should not try to emulate the US economy 
The European economic and social model needs to change but not so much so that social and environmental issues take backseat to economic growth 
In that sense the Lisbon agenda is sailing into unchartered waters 
The Kok report tries to do away with belief that jobs need to be sacrificed at the altar of economic growth 
It's very ambitious said John Palmer political director at the European Policy Centre Brussels-based think-tank 
This is something that no advanced economy in the world has tried to do 
It's going to require quite new and innovative policies 
But some analysts believe that the Kok report doesn't come up with the sort of innovative policies and thinking needed to make the Lisbon targets reality 
For example it recommends putting in place policies which encourage women and older people to remain in the workforce 
But it doesn't say how companies should be convinced to do this 
It will be up to the incoming president of the European Commission Jose Manuel Barroso to adopt Mr Kok's recommendations and press them on EU governments 
Mr Barroso has said that the EU's competitiveness will be his top priority 
He expects his five-year term in office to be judged on Europe's success in meeting the Lisbon agenda

General Motors the world's largest car maker has confirmed that it will build new medium-sized Cadillac BLS at its loss-making Saab factory in Sweden 
The car unveiled at the Geneva motor show is intended to compete in the medium-sized luxury car market 
It will not be sold in the US said GM Europe president Carl-Peter Forster 
As part of its efforts to make the US marque appeal to European drivers the car will be the first Cadillac with diesel engine 
GM's announcement should go some way to allay fears of the Saab factory's closure 
The factory in Trollhaettan has been at the centre of rumours about GM's planned severe cutbacks in its troubled European operations 
But the group's new commitment to the Swedish factory may not be welcomed by the group's Opel workers in Ruesselsheim Germany 
They may now have to face larger proportion of GM's cuts 
Neither will the announcement be seen as unalloyed good news in Sweden since it reflects Saab's failure to make significant inroads into the lucrative European luxury car market 
For years Saab has consistently said it is competing head-on with BMW Mercedes and Jaguar 
The segment's leaders do not agree 
GM's plans to build the American marque in Sweden is part of its efforts to push it as an alternative luxury brand for European drivers 
In the US it has long been established as an upmarket brand even the presidential limousine carries the badge 
Yet it could prove tough for Cadillac to steal market share from the majors in Europe 
Other luxury car makers most notably the Toyota subsidiary Lexus have enjoyed tremendous success in the US without managing to make significant inroads in Europe 
There German marques Mercedes Benz and BMW have retained their stranglehold on the luxury market 
Bringing Cadillac production to Sweden should help introduce desperately-needed scale to the Saab factory which currently produces fewer than cars per year 
That is about half of what major car makers consider sufficient numbers for profitable operations and Saab is losing money fast albeit with losses halved in to euros from the previous year 
Beyond the job cuts announced last year at its European operations GM is reducing expenditure by building Saabs Opels badged as Vauxhalls in the UK and now Cadillacs on the same framework and by allowing the different brands to share parts 
Another way to further reduce Saab's losses could be to shift some of the production of Saabs to the US market where drivers have adopted it as an upmarket European car 
Doing so would remove the exposure to the weak US dollar which is making Saabs more expensive to US consumers 
But not everyone in the industry agree that it would be the best way forward 
We know that in five years the US dollar will be stronger than it is today the chief executive of leading European car maker told BBC News 
The current trend towards US production was stupid he said 
In separate announcement GM unveiled new scheme to allow European consumers the chance to test drive its Opel and Vauxhall models 
It is to deploy fleet of test cars across countries inviting potential buyers to try out vehicle for -hours 
It follows similar initiative by GM in the US 
GM said it wanted to change customers' perceptions about Opel and Vauxhall cars showing them that the quality had improved in recent years

Shares in Elan and Biogen Idec plunged on Monday as the firms suspended sales of new multiple sclerosis drug Tysabri after patient's death in the US 
On the New York Stock Exchange shares in Ireland-based Elan lost while US partner Biogen Idec shed 
The firms took action after the death from central nervous system disease and suspected case of the condition 
The cases cited involved the use of both Tysabri and Avonex Biogen Idec's existing multiple sclerosis drug 
The companies said they have no reports of the rare condition progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy PML in patients taking either Tysabri or Avonex alone 
Tysabri was approved for use in the US last November and was widely tipped to become the world's leading multiple sclerosis treatment 
The companies will work with clinical investigators to evaluate Tysabri-treated patients and will consult with leading experts to better understand the possible risk of PML the two firms said in statement 
The outcome of these evaluations will be used to determine possible re-initiation of dosing in clinical trials and future commercial availability 

Analysts had believed the product would provide new growth opportunity for Biogen Idec which had faced increased competition from rivals to Avonex 
Elan once the biggest firm on the Irish stock exchange was also expected to receive boost from the new product 
An inquiry into Elan's accounts in brought the group close to bankruptcy but the firm has been rebuilding itself since with its share price increasing by almost four-fold last year

The decision to keep interest rates on hold at earlier this month was passed by the Bank of England's rate-setting body minutes have shown 
One member of the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee MPC Paul Tucker voted to raise rates to 
The news surprised some analysts who had expected the latest minutes to show another unanimous decision 
Worries over growth rates and consumer spending were behind the decision to freeze rates the minutes showed 
The Bank's latest inflation report released last week had noted that the main reason inflation might fall was weaker consumer spending 
However MPC member Paul Tucker voted for quarter point rise in interest rates to 
He argued that economic growth was picking up and that the equity credit and housing markets had been stronger than expected 
The Bank's minutes said that risks to the inflation forecast were sufficiently to the downside to keep rates on hold at its latest meeting 
However the minutes added Some members noted that an increase might be warranted in due course if the economy evolved in line with the central projection 
Ross Walker UK economist at Royal Bank of Scotland said he was surprised that dissenting vote had been made so soon 
He said the minutes appeared to be trying to get the market to focus on the possibility of rise in rates 
If the economy pans out as they expect then they are probably going to have to hike rates 
However he added any rate increase is not likely to happen until later this year with MPC members likely to look for more sustainable pick up in consumer spending before acting

Cold weather across parts of the United States and much of Europe has pushed US crude oil prices above barrel for the first time in almost three months 
Freezing temperatures and heavy snowfall have increased demand for heating fuel in the US where stocks are low 
Fresh falls in the value of the dollar helped carry prices above the mark for the first time since November

Brent crude also rose in London trading adding to at the close 
Much of western Europe and the north east of America has been shivering under unseasonably low temperatures in recent days 
The decline in the US dollar to five-week low against the euro has also served to inflate prices 
The dollar moved sharply overnight and oil is following it said Chris Furness senior market strategist at Cast 
If the dollar continues to weaken oil will be obviously higher 

Several Opec members said cut in production was unlikely citing rising prices and strong demand for oil from Asia 
agree that we do not need to cut supply if the prices are as much as this Fathi Bin Shatwan Libya's oil minister told Reuters 
do not think we need to cut unless the prices are falling below barrel he added 
Opec closely watches global stocks to ensure that there is not an excessive supply in the market 
The arrival of spring in the northern hemisphere will focus attention on stockpiles of US crude and gasoline which are up to higher than at this time last year 
Heavy stockpiles could help force prices lower when demand eases

Prices of homes in the UK rose seasonally adjusted in February says the Nationwide building society 
The figure means the annual rate of increase in the UK is down to the lowest rate since June

Nationwide said that in January house prices went up by on the month and by on year earlier 
We are not seeing the market collapsing in the way some had feared said Nationwide economist Alex Bannister 
There have been number of warnings that the UK housing market may be heading for downturn after four years of strong growth to

And last summer economists at PricewaterhouseCoopers PWC warned house prices were overvalued and could fall by between and by

Homeowners now expect house prices to rise by over the next six months Mr Bannister said 
He said if the growth continued at this level then the Bank of England may increase interest rates from their current

We always thought we would see small rise they thought they would see small decline 
House prices have risen this year Nationwide said and if this pace of increase persists prices would rise by just under in the year to December 
This is slightly above the range Nationwide predicts 
Further evidence of slowdown in the housing market emerged from Bank of England lending figures released on Tuesday

Chancellor Gordon Brown has been given bn boost in his attempts to meet his golden economic rule which allows him to borrow only for investment 
The extra leeway came after the Office for National Statistics said it had been measuring road expenditure data wrongly over the past five years 
It comes just weeks ahead of the Budget and an expected general election 
Shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin said At best the timing of these changes is very convenient for the government 

review by the ONS found it had made mistake by double counting some spending on roads since 
Correcting the error would mean reducing current expenditure and increasing net investment thus helping Mr Brown to meet his golden rule of borrowing only to invest over the economic cycle 
Economists speculated that it might also allow for some vote-catching measures in the Budget 
The changes by the ONS increase the current budget measure for the past five years by bn in total 
Mr Letwin said This is very murky area 
There will inevitably be suspicions that the figures are being fiddled 
The Conservatives also said Mr Brown would still be forced to raise taxes after the general election to fill an annual bn black hole in the nation's coffers 
But the Treasury said there would be no relaxation of economic discipline and the golden rule would be met even without the data revisions 
In January the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies IFS said Mr Brown would need to raise taxes to get public finances onto the track predicted in last year's Budget 
It also said the government might narrowly miss its golden rule if the current economic cycle ended in 
After the ONS announcement economists said there could also be proportionate boost to the current budget in of about 
None of this changes the big picture of dramatic deterioration in the overall fiscal position over the last four or five years said Jonathan Loynes chief UK economist at Capital Economics 
Accordingly it seems very likely that some form of fiscal consolidation will be required in due course

Japanese industry is growing faster than expected boosting hopes that the country's retreat back into recession is over 
Industrial output rose adjusted for the time of year in January from month earlier 
At the same time retail sales picked up faster than at any time since 
The news sent Tokyo shares to an eight-month high as investors hoped for recovery from the three quarters of contraction seen from April on 
The Nikkei index ended the day up at points with the yen strengthening against the dollar to yen 
Weaker exports normally the engine for Japan's economy in the face of weak domestic demand had helped trigger contraction in the final three months of last year after two previous quarters of shrinking GDP 
Only an exceptionally strong performance in the early months of kept the year as whole from showing decline 
The output figures brought cautiously optimistic response from economic officials 
Overall see low risk of the economy falling into serious recession said Bank of Japan chief Toshihiko Fukui despite warning that other indicators such as the growth numbers had been worrying 
Within the overall industrial output figure there were signs of pullback from the export slowdown 
Among the best-performing sectors were key overseas sales areas such as cars chemicals and electronic goods 
With US growth doing better than expected the picture for exports in early could also be one of sustained demand 
Electronics were also one of the keys to the improved domestic market with products such as flat-screen TVs in high demand during January

India is to boost spending on primary schools and health in budget flagged as boost for the ordinary citizen 
India's defence budget has also been raised to bn rupees bn 
The priority for Finance Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram is to fight poverty and keep the government's Communist allies onside 
But his options are limited by new law which makes him cut the budget deficit which he said would be of GDP in the year to March 
The country's overall deficit is thought to be more than if the spending of India's states and territories is included 
Under the fiscal responsibility law Mr Chidambaram has to trim the deficit by percentage points each year target he says he has now met for the current year 
But the heavy spending on poverty reduction means the target for the deficit will be Mr Chidambaram said falling short of the new law's requirement 
was left with no option but to press the pause button vis vis the act he said 
The following year though would have to be back on track he warned 
may add that we are perilously close to the limits of fiscal prudence and there is no more room for spending beyond our means he said 
The coming year's reduction has meant bringing more of the businesses in India's burgeoning services sector into the tax system and restructuring the personal tax system although there are numerous corporate tax and duty reductions built into the budget 
Presenting his budget in the lower house of parliament Mr Chidambaram said the Indian economy was performing strongly and that inflation has been reined in 
He said India's economy grew in 
In his budget Mr Chidambaram has

Announced that bn rupees bn will be spent on building rural infrastructure

Increased flow of funds to agriculture by 
Announced package for the sugar industry 
In addition up to bn rupees bn to be spent on infrastructure will be sourced by borrowing against the country's foreign exchange reserves keeping budgeted spending under control 
Given the resilience of the Indian economy 
it is possible to launch direct assault on poverty Mr Chidambaram said 
The whole purpose of democratic government is to eliminate poverty 
The new Indian government led by the Congress Party was voted into power last May after it pledged to introduce economic reforms with human face 
The finance minister says he is committed to continue reforming India's tax system while expanding the tax base 
As part of his reforms he has announced 
Duty cuts on capital goods and raw materials 
Expanded service tax net 
Raised the income-tax threshold to rupees 
Reduced income tax for those earning less than rupees to 
Reduced corporate tax rates to 
An annual economic survey released on Friday said India needed to ease limit restriction on foreign investment reform labour laws and cut duties apart from widening the tax base for long-term economic growth 
But Mr Chidambaram is under pressure from the Communist parties to focus on increasing social spending 
The Communists are also hostile to measures seeking to increase foreign investment and allow companies to hire and fire employees at will 
In recent months they have expressed their displeasure at the government's economic reform plans including increasing foreign direct investment in telecommunication and aviation 
In his last budget Mr Chidambaram had pledged billions of dollars for improving education and health services for the poor as well as special assistance for farmers

General Motors of the US is to pay Fiat bn euros bn bn to get out of deal which could have forced it to buy the Italian car maker outright 
Fiat had sold GM stake in as part of partnership agreement 
But Fiat's heavy losses have convinced GM whose own European operations are in the red to back away 
The pay-off means the two firms will unwind joint ventures but Fiat will keep supplying diesel engines and the money will allow it to reduce its debt 
Fiat's shares on the Milan stock exchange rose by GMT to euros having shot up more than in early trading 
We now have absolute freedom to design our own future said Fiat chief executive Sergio Marchionne 
Analysts said Fiat seemed to have done well out of the deal although some predictions had expected bn euro pay-off 
Fiat is to get bn euros immediately with another to follow within days 
The firm is Italy's largest private employer and failure to reach an agreement could have had severe consequences for thousands of workers and for the Italian economy 
For its part GM was keen to ward off any criticism that the deal had been mistake 
We needed scale in Europe to get costs down and we were able to do that in working with Fiat said GM chief executive Rick Wagoner 
The Fiat-GM alliance came about in as an alternative to selling Fiat outright 
German-US car firm DaimlerChrysler had been willing to buy the firm but Fiat patriarch Gianni Agnelli did not want to give up control 
Instead GM swapped stake in itself for of Fiat and gave Fiat put option to sell GM the rest of the car maker between January and July 
But despite the alliance Fiat failed to put itself back on track continuing to lose money and market share 
As result the sell-off looked better and better for the Italians and much worse for GM which is struggling with its own loss-making European marques Opel and Saab

An ex-chief financial officer at Boeing has received four-month jail sentence and fine of for illegally hiring top Air Force aide 
Michael Sears admitted his guilt in breaking conflict of interest laws by recruiting Darleen Druyun while she still handled military contracts 
Ms Druyun is currently serving nine month sentence for favouring Boeing when awarding lucrative contracts 
Boeing lost bn government contract after Pentagon inquiry into the case 
The contract to provide refuelling tankers for the US Air Force was cancelled last year 
The Pentagon revealed earlier this week that it would examine eight other contracts worth bn which it believes may have been tainted by Ms Druyun's role in the procurement process 
Boeing sacked Mr Sears and Ms Druyun in November after allegations that they had violated company recruitment policy 
Ms Druyun had talks with Mr Sears in October about working for Boeing while she was still top procurement official within the Pentagon 
She subsequently joined the company in January 
Ms Druyun admitted that she had steered multi-billion dollar contracts to Boeing and other favoured companies 
In documents filed in Virginia court ahead of Mr Sears' sentencing prosecutors blamed Boeing's senior management for failing to ask key questions about the legal and ethical issues surrounding Ms Druyun's appointment 
Mr Sears told prosecutors that no other Boeing officials were aware that Ms Druyun was still responsible for major procurement decisions at the time she was discussing job with Boeing

Verizon has won takeover battle for US phone firm MCI with bid worth bn bn reports say 
The two firms are expected to seal the deal on Monday morning according to news agency reports despite what was thought to be higher bid from Qwest 
The US telecoms market is consolidating fast with former long-distance giant AT being bought by former subsidiary SBC earlier this year for bn 
MCI exited bankruptcy in April having gone bust under previous name WorldCom 
The bankruptcy followed its admission in that it illegally booked expenses and inflated profits 
Shareholders lost about bn when the company collapsed while workers lost their jobs 
Former Worldcom boss Bernie Ebbers is currently on trial accused of overseeing an bn fraud 
Qwest has itself come under suspicion of sub-standard behaviour paying the Securities and Exchange Commission in October to settle charges that it manipulated its results to keep Wall Street happy 
MCI is the US's second-biggest long distance firm after AT 
Consolidation in the US telecommunications industry has picked up in the past few months as companies look to cut costs and boost client bases 
merger between MCI and Verizon would be the fifth billion-dollar telecoms deal since October 
Last week SBC Communications agreed to buy its former parent and phone trailblazer AT for about bn 
Buying MCI would give either Qwest or Verizon access to MCI's global network and business-based subscribers 
The rationale is similar to the one underpinning SBC's AT deal 
Verizon is by far the bigger company and has its own successful mobile arm factors which may have swung the board in its favour since both suitors are offering mixture of cash and shares

Wholesale prices in the US rose at the fastest rate in more than six years in January according to government data 
New figures show the Labor Department producer price index PPI rose by in line with forecasts 
But core producer prices which exclude food and energy costs surged by the biggest rise since December increasing inflationary concerns 
In contrast the University of Michigan barometer of US retail consumer confidence showed slight dip 
The university's index of consumer spending fell to in early February from in January which could indicate fall in retail spending by the US public 
The mixed set of data on Friday led to volatile early Wall Street trade as the Dow Jones Standard and Poor's and Nasdaq swung between positive and negative territory 
The economic figures come on the back of increased fears that the Federal Reserve chairman may be about to raise interest rates in order to stifle any inflationary pressures 
The Fed has been raising interest rates at gradual pace since June in an attempt to make sure inflation does not get out of control 
Mr Greenspan told Congress this week that the central bank was on guard against the possibility that rebounding economy could trigger stronger inflation pressures 
The PPI would argue for Greenspan to continue to raise rates at measured pace said Joe Quinlan chief market stategist at Bank of America Capital Management 
But this Michigan survey tells you that the consumer might be downshifting little bit in terms of their confidence and their spending this could be an indication of that 

Consumer spending accounts for of US economic activity and is viewed as gauge of the health of the economy which is why the Michigan data is closely observed 
However on Friday it was overshadowed by the core PPI core figure which surged during the past months the biggest year-on-year gain in nine years 
The concern is that traders might interpret this big jump in the core PPI as an impetus for the Fed to be more aggressive than measured move in moving rates said Paul Cherney chief market analyst at Standard Poor's 
But Ian Shepherdson chief US economist at High Frequency Economics said the PPI report was much less alarming than at first glance 
One-time increases in alcohol and tobacco prices which are no indication of broad PPI pressure were responsible for the increase he said 
Prices for autos and trucks also jumped in January but Shepherdson said it is good bet these increases won't stick

Russian oil firm Yukos has sued four companies for their role in last year's forced state auction of its key oil production unit Yuganskneftegas 
Yukos is claiming more than bn bn in damages after Yugansk was sold in December to settle back taxes 
The four companies named in the law suit are gas giant Gazprom its unit Gazpromneft investment company Baikal and state oil firm Rosneft 
Yukos submitted the suit in Houston where it filed for bankruptcy 
As well as suing for damages Yukos has asked the US court to send its tax dispute with the Russian government to an international arbitrator 
It also has submitted reorganisation plan as part of its Chapter bankruptcy filing 
The clash between Yukos and the Kremlin came to head last year when Yukos was hit with bill of more than bn in back taxes and unpaid fines 
To settle the bill Russia forced Yukos to sell off Yuganskneftegas 
Yukos called the sale illegal and has turned to courts in the US in an effort to regain control of the oil production business 
It also has vowed to use all legal means at its disposal to go after any firm that tries to buy or take control of its assets 
Earlier this month it sued the Russian government for bn 
Analysts have questioned whether US court has any jurisdiction over Russian companies while Moscow officials have dismissed Yukos' legal wrangling as meaningless 
In Houston bankruptcy Judge Letitia Clark will start two-day hearing on February to hear arguments on whether US court is the proper forum for the case 
The threat of legal action from Yukos and its bankruptcy filing in Houston did have an effect on last year's auction however 
Concerned that it would be caught up in court battle Gazprom and Gazpromneft withdrew from the auction and Yuganskneftegas was sold to little-known investment firm Baikal Finance Group 
few days later Baikal gave control of the company to state-run oil group Rosneft for bn 
Rosneft meanwhile has agreed to merge with Gazprom bringing large chunk of Russia's very profitable oil business back under state control

US economic growth accelerated in the third quarter helped by strong consumer spending official figures have shown 
The economy expanded at an annual rate of in the July to September period the Commerce Department said 
The figure marked an increase on the growth recorded in the second quarter but fell short of the rate pencilled in by forecasters 
The increase reflected the biggest jump in consumer spending in year 
It was little softer than the consensus but not real surprise said Gary Thayer an economist at AG Edwards Sons 
Friday's growth estimate is one of the last significant pieces of economic data before the November presidential election 
Democrat challenger John Kerry has criticised President George Bush's handling of the economy pointing to net loss of over jobs since Mr Bush took office 
Analysts said the economy was still not growing fast enough to stimulate large-scale job creation 
It's pretty good growth rate but it may not be good enough to create enough jobs said Robert Brusca chief economist at Fact and Opinion Economics in New York 
However President Bush is expected to point to Commerce Department figures showing that consumer spending grew at in the third quarter up from just in the second as evidence that his policies are generating solid growth 
Consumer spending accounts for about two thirds of all economic activity in the US 
The weaker than expected growth figure makes it less likely that the US Federal Reserve will raise interest rates next month economists said 
The economy regained some traction in the third quarter but the growth is not robust AG Edwards' Thayer 
think that means the Fed can take its time raising rates 
We'll probably see one more rate hike before the end of the year

One of the world's largest manufacturers of HIV Aids drugs has launched an initiative to combat the smuggling of cheaper pills supplied to poorer African countries back into Europe for resale at far higher price 
The company GlaxoSmithKline is to alter the packaging and change the colour of the pills currently provided to developing nations under humanitarian agreement 
It is estimated that drugs companies are losing hundreds of millions of dollars each year as result of the diversion of their products in this way 
This is very sensitive area for the big drugs companies 
They want to maintain their profits but have been put under tremendous pressure to provide cheap anti-Aids drugs to the world's poorest nations 
The result is that drugs supplied to Africa are now more than thirty times cheaper than those sold in Europe bringing these medicines within the reach of millions of HIV-positive Africans through their government's health care systems 
But the wide difference in price also means that there are big gains to be made from illegally diverting these cheaper drugs back into wealthier countries and re-selling them at higher price 
GlaxoSmithKline believes that by coating the pills destined for Africa in red dye and adding new identification codes both onto the pills and on the packaging then this trade can be substantially reduced 
The company says that it will then be possible to identify specific distributors in Africa who have re-sold humanitarian drugs for profit as well as those suppliers in Europe that have also been involved in the trade 
Glaxo says distribution of the new-look drugs has already begun and that their chemical content is identical to those currently being sold in Europe

India and Russia are to work together in series of energy deals part of pact which could see India invest up to bn in oil and gas projects 
On the agenda are oil and gas extraction as well as transportation deals to be led by Russian energy giant Gazprom and India's ONGC 
The Indian firm is also expected to hold talks on Tuesday about buying stake in assets once owned by Yukos 
It is reported to be keen on buying stake in oil unit Yuganskneftegas 
The former Yukos subsidiary was controversially sold off last year and eventually acquired by state-owned energy giant Rosneft 
Russian media reported that India and Russia signed memorandum of understanding on energy co-operation on Tuesday during meeting between Oil and Natural Gas Corporation chairman Subir Raha Gazprom chairman Aleksey Miller and India's petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyar 
The agreement is likely to see the two companies develop refining facilities in Russia India and elsewhere and organise delivery of oil gas and petrochemicals from Russia to India and other countries across Asia 
ONGC could invest in gas and oil fields in Sakhalin in the far east of Russia and may also take part in joint tender bids for projects in eastern Siberia and the Caspian Sea 
India is urgently searching for fresh energy supplies particularly liquefied natural gas as domestic demand is growing at more than year 
ONGC's Mr Raha said the two could work together on joint bids from next year 
At current oil and gas prices our cash flow situation is good he told Reuters 
What we are saying is Gazprom has huge amount of gas and we have the money 
The investment may go up to bn or more for period of five years or so 

Russian news agencies reported that India's petroleum minister Mr Aiyar and Russian energy minister Viktor Khristenko would discuss the future of Yugansk at meeting on Tuesday 
ONGC's Mr Raha declined to be drawn on his firm's reported interest in the company 
However he stressed that ONGC was not interested in 'loan-for-oil deal' in connection to Yugansk similar to that concluded recently between Rosneft and China's National Petroleum Corporation 
China's problem is it has immediate demand and they needed the oil for their coastal refineries 
We do not 
We would like long-term security through equity participation 
It is thought that any decision over Yugansk will be delayed until US court has decided whether to grant Yukos bankruptcy protection 
Yukos is suing host of companies involved in the sale of Yugansk auctioned off to pay huge back-tax bill 
It has also threatened legal action against any business which has future commercial dealings with its former subsidiary

batch of downbeat government data has cast doubt over the French economy's future prospects 
Official figures showed on Friday that unemployment was unchanged at last month while consumer confidence fell unexpectedly in October 
At the same time finance minister Nicolas Sarkozy warned that high oil prices posed threat to French growth 
Oil prices will weigh on consumer spending in the short term and potentially on confidence he said 
World oil prices have risen by more than since the start of the year as production struggles to keep pace with soaring demand 
Analysts said French companies keen to protect their profit margins at time of rising energy costs were reluctant to take on extra staff 
The unemployment figures show the main problem of the French economy we have growth but without an improvement in employment said Marc Touati an economist at Natexis Banques Populaires 
Politicians must have the will and guts to solve structural unemployment with thorough reforms otherwise in five or ten years it will be too late 
Obligatory employer contributions to worker welfare programmes mean that it costs more to hire staff in France than in many other European economies 
Many economists have urged the government to stimulate employment by reducing non-wage payroll costs and by scrapping restrictions on working hours 
The French statistics agency INSEE expects the economy to grow by about this year buoyed by strong consumer spending and business investment 
That is above the projected eurozone average of just above

As European leaders gather in Rome on Friday to sign the new EU constitution many companies will be focusing on matters much closer to home namely how to stay in business 
Lille is popular tourist destination for Britons who want taste of France at the weekend 
But how many tourists look at the impressively grand Victorian Chambre de Commerce which stands beside the Opera House and consider that it was built like the town halls in many northern English towns on the wealth created by coal steel and textiles 
Like northern England and industrial Scotland those industries have been in long term decline the last coal pit closed in 
Beck-Crespel is specialist steel firm in Armentieres about miles from Lille 
The company has not laid off worker since 
It specialises in making bolts and fixings for power stations and the oil industry but not many of those are being built in Europe these days 
Director Hugues Charbonnier says he is under pressure because factories in the Far East are able to make some of his output more cheaply while his key markets are now in China and India 
In our business the market is absolutely global you can not imagine living with our size of business even within an enlarged European Union if we did that we would need not people but perhaps just or he says 
It isn't just globalisation that is hurting the law in France means workers are paid for hour week even though they work just hours 
But at least there is still steel industry 
Coal has now totally vanished and textiles are struggling 
New business has been attracted but not enough to make up the difference 
That is one reason why people here are not great fans of the EU says Frederic Sawicki politics lecturer at the University of Lille 
In the region today the unemployment rate is in some areas it is 
They don't see what Europe is doing for them so there is kind of euro scepticism especially in the working classes he says 
Which is strange because Lille is at the crossroads of Europe if anywhere should be benefiting from the euro it is here 
The euro was designed to increase trade within the eurozone but the biggest increase in trade has been with the rest of the world 
Much of that trade passes through the world's largest port Rotterdam in Holland home to specialist crane maker Huisman Itrec 
Its cranes help build oil rigs and lifted the sunken Russian submarine Kursk from the sea bed but Huisman Itrec is now setting up factory in China where costs are cheaper and its main customers are closer 
Boss Henk Addink blames the low growth rate in Europe for the lack of orders closer to home 
In the US growth is something like in China they are estimating and in the EU it is more or less he says 
Mr Addink blames the euro for stifling demand 
He much preferred the old currencies of Europe which moved in relation to each country's economic performance 
In Germany industry is exporting more these days but the economy as whole is once again mired in slow growth and high unemployment 
Growth is likely to peak this year at just under 
In Britain that would be bad year in Germany it is one of the best in recent years 
With Germany making up third of the eurozone's economy this is major problem 
If Germany doesn't once again become the powerhouse of Europe growth across the bloc is never going to be as strong as it could be 
However at one factory near the Dutch border things are changing 
The Siemens plant at Boscholt makes cordless phones and employs staff 
Staff have started working an extra four hours week for no extra pay after Siemens threatened to take the factory and their jobs to Hungary 
Factory manager Herbert Stueker says that he now hopes to increase productivity by nearly 
But Germany needs much more reform if all its industry is to compete with places such Hungary or China 
The Government is reforming the labour market and cutting the generous unemployment system but the real solution is to cut the wages of low skilled workers says Helmut Schneider director of the Institute for the Study of Labour at Bonn University 
Labour is too costly in Germany especially for the low skilled labour and this is the main problem 
If we could solve that problem we could cut unemployment by half he says 
The EU set itself the target of being the most efficient economy in the world by 
Four years into that process and the target seems further away than ever

As well as trying to lure investors with the promise of better returns Qwest also reckons that its offer will face less regulatory scrutiny than Verizon's 
The takeover would be the fifth billion-dollar telecoms deal since October as companies look to cut costs and boost client bases 
Earlier this month SBC Communications agreed to buy its former parent and phone trailblazer AT for about bn 
There may be concerns other than cash however especially as MCI only emerged from bankruptcy protection last April 
Verizon is far bigger than Qwest has fewer debts and has built successful mobile division 
Also MCI while trading under the name Worldcom became the biggest corporate bankruptcy in US history after admitting that it illegally booked expenses and inflated profits 
Former Worldcom boss Bernie Ebbers is currently standing trial accused of overseeing an bn fraud 
Qwest meanwhile had to pay the Securities and Exchange Commission in October to settle charges that it massaged earnings to keep Wall Street happy

France's economic growth accelerated in the last three months of driven by consumer spending report shows 
Gross domestic product GDP rose by in the fourth quarter compared with the previous three month period the statistical office INSEE said 
That expansion pushed annual growth to the fastest rate in two years 
Consumer spending was up by in the fourth quarter and there also was rebound in business investment that gave the recovery an extra shove 
Analysts warned that France still was facing challenges and was unlikely to keep expanding at its current pace 
France still has strong economic growth said Marc Toutai an economist at Natexis Banques Populaires 
But if we check the figures in detail there's problem 
Consumer spending is still high 
But French households have spent their savings to consume 
France can't sustain high growth rate without an improvement in the job market 
There's too much of gap between growth and employment 
Unemployment levels are currently stuck at about and is proving difficult to bring down despite government efforts 
Another worry is that demand in Germany and Italy two of France's main trading partners is sluggish 
Despite the concerns analysts pointed out that France was outperforming the majority of its European counterparts and that its economy was looking more robust than in previous years 
As well as strong domestic demand exports climbed by in the fourth quarter the biggest increase in foreign sales for year 
It's an economic growth that seems well balanced said Nicolas Claquin an analyst at CCF 
In the beginning of growth was mainly driven by consumer spending 
Here it gets contributions from investment and exports though household consumption is still strong 
But we expect overall economic growth to fall to percent in

US food and drug regulators will decide on Friday whether to recommend the sale of painkillers that have been linked to high risk of heart attack and stroke 
The Food and Drug Administration FDA advisory panel will give its verdict after hearing evidence for three days 
The painkillers called COX- inhibitors are sold under brand names such as Celebrex and Vioxx 
Vioxx was withdrawn from shops last year but Merck said it would consider selling it if it gets FDA approval 
The FDA has been asked to decide if the benefits to patients justify the increased risks 
Putting Vioxx back on the shelves is likely to boost profits at Merck and make easier any legal battles with people who claim to have been injured by the drug analysts said 
Merck voluntarily stopped sales of Vioxx on September move which caused the firm's fourth-quarter earnings to slide to bn from bn year earlier 
Merck's shares tumbled more than on the news and the company has had to set aside millions of dollars to cover the cost of Vioxx-related litigation 
Alarm bells were rung by research note called Approve which showed that the risk of heart attack and stroke doubled in patients who had been taking the drug for at least months 
The Cox- inhibitors were developed by drug companies including Merck and Pfizer because they cause users fewer stomach problems than other painkillers 
Pfizer is still selling its Celebrex and Bextra products though investigations have suggested that they may also be harmful to the heart 
Merck's announcement of possible reintroduction of Vioxx caught analysts by surprise 
Merck's head of research Peter Kim said that it withdrew Vioxx based on the information that was available to us at the time knowing there were alternative therapies 
He went on to say that things have since changed in the light of new reports 
Given this new information its is not clear that the cardiovascular risk observed in Approve makes Vioxx unique in the class of similar drugs marketed in the US Mr Kim explained 
On Thursday David Graham from the FDA's Office of Drug Safety told the advisory panel that there really doesn't appear to be need for Cox- inhibitors 
According to calculations presented to the US Senate by Dr Graham in November Vioxx may be linked to as many as to American deaths 
Facing stem criticism for its handling of the Vioxx case the FDA said on Tuesday that it will create an independent body to oversee the safety of drugs already in the market place 
European regulators meanwhile ruled on Thursday that patients who have had heart disease or stroke should not take Cox- inhibitors 
The European Medicines Agency also said doctors should be cautious about giving the drugs to patients who have risk factors for heart disease

Russian authorities do not have to abide by any US court decisions taken with regard to troubled oil giant Yukos Houston court has been told 
Legal expert William Butler said there was no treaty between the US and Russia to recognise the other's legal rulings 
That meant Moscow would not have to adhere to US rulings in the Yukos case 
Yukos says US court was entitled to declare it bankrupt before its Yugansk unit was sold since it has US subsidiary and local bank accounts 
Yukos made its surprise Chapter bankruptcy filing in Houston in December in an unsuccessful attempt to halt the auction of Yugansk its main oil producing unit by Russian authorities 
Yugansk was sold to help pay off bn bn back tax bill 
It was bought for bn by previously unknown group which was in turn bought by state-controlled oil company Rosneft 
The US court's jurisdiction has been challenged by Deutsche Bank and Gazpromneft former unit of Russian gas monopoly Gazprom which is due to merge with Rosneft 
Deutsche Bank maintains the case has no place in US court because Yukos has no assets in the US apart from two bank accounts and house in Houston owned by its chief finance officer Bruce Misamore 
Deutsche Bank is involved in the case because it is itself being sued by Yukos 
It had agreed to loan Gazpromneft the money to bid for Yugansk 
US bankruptcy judge Letitia Clark who issued an injunction in December to try and prevent the Yugansk sale has said she will rule pretty promptly however do not anticipate ruling on it before next Tuesday 
Yukos has claimed it sought help in the US because other forums Russian courts and the European Court of Human Rights were either unfriendly or offered less protection 
It has claimed that Russia imposed the huge tax bill and forced the sale of Yugansk as part of campaign to destroy Yukos and its former owner Mihkail Khodorkovsky who is facing -year prison term in Russia for fraud and tax evasion 
Yukos' parent company the Gibraltar-based Menatep Group is suing Russia in Europe for bn in financial damages 
The company is also seeking bn in separate US lawsuit against Rosneft and Gazprom for their role in the sale of Yugansk

The UK government will have to raise taxes or rein in spending if it wants to avoid breaking its golden rule report suggests 
The rule states that the government can borrow cash only to invest and not to finance its spending projects 
The National Institute of Economic and Social Research NIESR claims that taxes need to rise by about bn if state finances are to be put in order 
The Treasury said its plans were on track and funded until 
According to NIESR if the government's current economic cycle runs until March then it is unlikely the golden rule will be met 
Should the cycle end year earlier then the chances improve to 
Either way fiscal tightening is needed NIESR said 
The report is the latest to call into question the viability of government spending projections 
Earlier this month accountancy firm Ernst Young said that Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown's forecasts for tax revenues were too optimistic

Treasury spokesperson dismissed the latest claims saying it was on track to meeting spending rules and the golden rule in the current cycle and beyond 
Spending plans have been set out until and they are fully affordable 
Other than its warning on possible tax hikes the NIESR report was optimistic about the state of the UK and global economy

The controversial sell-off of Ukrainian steel mill to relative of the former president was illegal court has ruled 
The mill Krivorizhstal was sold in June for well below other offers 
President Viktor Yushchenko elected in December is planning to revisit many of Ukraine's recent privatisations 
Krivorizhstal is one of dozens of firms which he says were sold cheaply to friends of the previous administration 
On Wednesday Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko said as many as firms could be included on the list of firms whose sale was being reviewed 
Mr Yushchenko had previously said the list would be limited to enterprises 
More than businesses in all from massive corporations to tiny shopfronts have been sold off since as the command economy built up when Ukraine was part of the Soviet Union was dismantled 
Analysts have suggested that the government needs to avoid the impression of an open-ended list so as to preserve investor confidence 
Thursday's ruling by district court in Perchesk overturned previous decision in lower court permitting the sale 
The consortium which won the auction for the mill was created by Viktor Pinchuk son-in-law of former-President Leonid Kuchma and Rinat Akhmetov the country's richest man 
The next step is for the supreme court to annul the sale altogether opening the way for Krivorizhstal to be resold 
Mr Yushchenko has suggested fair valuation could be as much as bn

Cairn said drilling to the north-west of its development site in Rajasthan had produced very strong results 
The company also said it now believed the development area would be able to produce oil for more than years 
Cairn's share price rose last year after number of oil finds but its shares were hit in December following disappointing drilling update 
December's share fall means that Cairn is still in danger of being relegated from the FTSE when the index is reshuffled next month 
Cairn's shares closed up pence or at on Thursday 
Before Christmas Cairn revealed that drilling to the north of the field in Rajasthan had been disappointing which caused its shares to lose in one day 
However on Thursday the group said its belief that the path of oil in the area actually moved further to the west had proved correct 
This area does need more appraisal drilling but it looks very strong Dr Mike Watts head of exploration said

Cairn made the discovery after having been granted an extension to their drilling licence in January by Indian authorities

Georgia is offering one-off 'tax amnesty' to people who hid their earnings under the regime of former president Eduard Shevardnadze 
The country's new president Mikhail Saakashvili has said that anyone now willing to disclose their wealth will only have to pay in income tax 
The measure is designed to legitimise previously hidden economic activity and boost Georgia's flagging economy 
Georgia's black market is estimated to be twice the size of its legal economy 
Mr Saakashvili elected president in January after Mr Shevardnadze was toppled has urged the Georgian Parliament to approve the amnesty as soon as possible 
It is one of series of proposals designed to tackle corruption which was rampant during the Shevardnadze era and boost Georgia's fragile public finances 
The new government is encouraging companies to pay taxes by scrapping existing corruption investigations and destroying all tax records from before January three days before President Saakashvili was elected 
There are people who have money but are afraid to show it the president told government session 
Documentation about where this money came from doesn't exist because under the former entirely warped regime earning capital honestly was not possible 

By declaring their assets and paying the one-off tax people would be able to legalise their property Mr Saakashvili stressed 
No one will have the right to check this money's origin 
This money must go back into the economy 
The amnesty will not extend to people who made money through drugs trafficking or international money laundering 
Criminal investigations in such cases -thought to involve about of Georgian businesses -are to continue 
Mr Saakashvili has accused the Shevardnadze regime which was toppled by popular uprising in November of allowing bribery to flourish 
Georgia's economy is in desperate condition 
Half the population are living below the poverty line with many surviving on income of less than or three euros day 
The unemployment rate is around while the country has bn public debt

Fidel Castro's decision to ban all cash transactions in US dollars in Cuba has once more turned the spotlight on Cuba's ailing economy 
All conversions between the US dollar and Cuba's convertible peso will from November be subject to tax 
Cuban citizens who receive money from overseas and foreign visitors who change dollars in Cuba will be affected 
Critics of the measure argue that it is step backwards reflecting the Cuban president's desire to increase his control of the economy and to clamp down on private enterprise 
In live television broadcast announcing the measure President Castro's chief aide said it was necessary because of the United States' increasing economic aggression 
The ten percent obligation applies exclusively to the dollar by virtue of the situation created by the new measures of the US government to suffocate our country he said 
The Bush administration has taken an increasingly harsh line on Cuba in recent months 
President Bush's government which has been strong supporter of the -year-old trade embargo on Cuba introduced even tighter restrictions on Cuba in May 
Cubans living in the US are now limited to one visit to Cuba every three years and they can only send money to their immediate relatives 
leading expert on the Cuban economy says that Castro's tax plan smacks more of desperate economic measure than political gesture 
think it is primarily an effort to raise some cash says Jose Barrionuevo head of strategy for Latin American emerging markets for Barclays Capital 
It underscores the fact that the economy is in very bad shape and the government is looking for sources of revenue 

The tax will hit the families of Cuban exiles hardest as they benefit from the money their displaced relatives send home 
This money known as remittances can amount to as much as bn year 
Those remaining in Cuba will have to pay the tax 
Their relatives abroad may choose to send money in other currencies which are not subject to the tax such as euros or increase their dollar payments to compensate 
However many of Cuban's poorest citizens could be worse off as result 
The tax will also affect the two million tourists who visit Cuba every year particularly those Americans who continue to defy ban on travel there 
Cuba's tourist industry has been one of its few economic success stories over the last ten years and according to the UN Economic Commission for Latin America is now worth bn to the country 
The tax is designed to provide much-needed revenue for Cuba's cash-strapped economy 
Cuba badly needs dollars to pay for essential items such as food fuel and medicine 
Much of Cuba's basic infrastructure is in state of disrepair 
In recent weeks Cuba has suffered its most serious power cuts in decade and there have also been water shortages in parts of the island 
Cuba's economy had staged modest recovery during the mid as the collapse of the Soviet Union forced it to embrace foreign capital decentralise trade and permit limited private enterprise 
However decline in foreign tourism since periodic hurricanes and the increasing costs of importing oil have put strain on the economy 
It has however yet to be seen if the tax will provide solution to the government's economic problems 
The tax could fuel an active black market in currency trading Mr Barrionuevo said 
The main impact could be that it will create black market which you typically see in countries like Venezuela which have restrictions on capital he says 
Mr Barrioneuvo says the measure could be dropped if it has damaging effect on economic activity 
It is intended to be permanent measure but am not sure it can last too long

Novartis which last month forecast record sales for said it had bought all of Germany's Hexal 
It also acquired of Hexal's US affiliate Eon Labs and offered to buy the remaining shares for each 
Novartis said that it would be able to make cost savings of about year following the acquisitions 
Novartis' shares rose to Swiss francs in early trading 
The deal will see Novartis' Sandoz business overtake Israel's Teva Pharmaceuticals as the world's biggest maker of generics 
Based on figures the newly merged producer would have sales of more than bn the company estimated 
Novartis said that it would merge number of departments adding that there may be job cuts 
The strong growth outlook for Sandoz which will create jobs is expected to partially compensate for necessary reductions in the work force the firm said in statement 
Generic drugs are chemically identical to their more expensive branded rivals 
Producers such as Sandoz can copy the branded products usually after their patent protection expires and can sell them more cheaply as they do not have to pay research and development cost 
There are more than generic drugmakers worldwide and analysts have predicted consolidation in market that they call fragmented 
However not all analysts were initially convinced about the deal 
This is very expensive acquisition Birgit Kuhlhoff from Sal Oppenheim investment bank told Reuters

shareholder in US phone firm MCI has taken legal action to halt bn bn buyout by telecoms giant Verizon hoping to get better deal 
The lawsuit was filed on Friday after Qwest Communications which had an earlier offer for MCI rejected said it would submit an improved bid 
MCI's directors have backed Verizon despite it tabling less money 
They are accused of breaching their fiduciary duties by depriving MCI shareholders of maximum value 
According the legal papers filed in Delaware court Verizon is set to pay an unconscionable unfair and grossly inadequate sum for MCI which was formerly known as Worldcom 
Qwest said on Wednesday that MCI had rejected deal worth bn 
number of large MCI shareholders expressed unhappiness at the decision saying that Verizon's offer made up of cash shares and dividends undervalued the company 
Friday's lawsuit argues that the Verizon offer makes no provision for future growth prospects and that consolidation in the US phone industry will put premium on MCI's network assets and clients 
MCI's directors have argued that Verizon is bigger than Qwest has fewer debts and has built successful mobile division 
Chief executive Michael Capellas spent last week meeting with shareholders in an effort to win their backing 
In investors in the then-named Worldcom lost millions when the company filed for bankruptcy following an accounting scandal 
However the firm now renamed MCI has put its operations in order and emerged from bankruptcy protection last April 
It is long-distance and corporate phone firm and would provide the buyer with access to global telecommunications network and large number of business-based subscribers

We are long-term investors and are experienced in removing management

The group owns more than of Deutsche more than enough to demand an extraordinary general meeting to call on shareholders to oust the German exchange's management 
Under German law Deutsche does not need investor backing to make takeover bid 
TCI and Atticus have opposed the LSE bid for some time saying it would destroy shareholder value and would be better spent on share buyback 
Deutsche is in competition with pan-European bourse Euronext to take over the London exchange 
Many commentators have suggested bidding war between the two could break out 
However any such move would have to wait until March when the Office of Fair Trading completes an investigation into the competition aspects of the pair's takeover proposals

President Bush is to send his toughest budget proposals to date to the US Congress seeking large cuts in domestic spending to lower the deficit 
About federal programs could be cut or axed altogether as part of trillion trillion package aimed at curbing the giant US budget deficit 
Defence spending will rise however while the proposals exclude the cost of continuing military operations in Iraq 
Vice-President Dick Cheney said the budget was the tightest so far 
At the heart of the administration's fifth budget presented to Congress on Monday is an austere package of domestic measures 
These would see discretionary spending rise below the projected level of inflation 
Such belt-tightening is designed to tackle the massive budget deficit increases of President Bush's first term 
Mr Cheney admitted that the budget was the toughest of the Bush Presidency but argued it was fair and responsible 
It is not something we have done with meat axe nor are we suddenly turning our back on the most needy people in our society he said 
The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan increased expenditure on national security after and the recession wiped out the budget surplus inherited by President Bush in and turned it into record deficit 
The shortfall is projected to rise to bn in 
Education environmental protection and transport initiatives are set to be scaled back as first step towards reducing the deficit to bn by 
Most controversially the government is seeking to cut the Medicaid budget which provides health care to the nation's poorest by bn and to reduce farm subsidies by 
Spending on defence and homeland security is set to increase although not by as much as originally planned 
President Bush's proposals would see the Pentagon's budget rise by bn to bn while homeland security would get an extra bn 
The budget does not include the cost of running military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan for which the administration in expected to seek an extra bn from Congress later this year 
Also not featuring in the proposals is the cost of funding the administration's radical proposed overhaul of social security provision 
Some expects believe this could require borrowing of up to bn trillion over twenty year period 
Despite the Republicans holding majority in both houses of Congress the proposals will be fiercely contested over the next few months 
John McCain Republican Senator said he was pleased the administration was prepared to tackle the deficit 
With the deficits that we are now running am glad the president is coming over with very austere budget he said 
However Democratic Senator Kent Conrad said the proposals exposed the country to huge financial commitments beyond

It is the sixth time in three years Standard Life has made cuts to bonus rates despite an rise in the value of the with-profits fund in 
The insurer blamed the cuts on poor share returns and low interest rates 
With-profits policies are designed to smooth out the peaks and troughs of stock market volatility 
Profits made in good years are kept in reserve to pay investors an annual bonus even when the stock market performs badly 
Slumping share prices throughout and forced most firms to trim bonus rates on their policies 
Standard Life came in for criticism for sticking with stock market investments during and 
The insurer argued that shares outperformed other investments over the long term and that policyholders would feel the benefit when the stock market recovered 
Recently Norwich Union and Axa Sun Life both cut their with-profit bonus rates 
John Gill managing director of the insurer's life and pensions division said that strong stock market recovery in the past two years had only partly compensated for losses during and 
In addition low interest rates meant that long-term investment returns are well below historic levels Mr Gill added

Shares in music giant EMI have sunk by more than after the firm issued profit warning following disappointing sales and delays to two album releases 
EMI said music sales for the year to March will fall from the year before with profits set to be lower than analysts had expected 
It blamed poor sales since Christmas and delays to the releases of new albums by Coldplay and Gorillaz 
By GMT on Monday EMI shares were down at pence 
EMI said two major albums scheduled for release before the end of the financial year in March one by Coldplay and one by Gorillaz have now had their release dates put back 
EMI Music's sales particularly re-orders in January have also been lower than anticipated and this is expected to continue through February and March the company added 
Therefore for the full year at constant currency EMI Music's sales are now expected to be to lower than the prior year 
The company said it expected profits to be about 
Alain Levy chairman and chief executive of EMI Music described the performance as disappointing but added that he remained optimistic over future trends in the industry 
The physical music market is showing signs of stabilisation in many parts of the world and digital music in all its forms continues to develop at rapid pace he said 
Commenting on the delay to the release of the Coldplay and Gorillaz albums Mr Levy said that creating and marketing music is not an exact science and cannot always coincide with our reporting periods 
While this rescheduling and recent softness is disappointing it does not change my views of the improving health of the global recorded music industry he added 
Paul Richards an analyst at Numis Securities said the market would be focusing on the slump in music sales rather than the timing of the two albums 
It's unusual to see this much of downgrade just because of phasing he said

The price of gold has fallen after the International Monetary Fund IMF said it will look at ways of using its gold reserves to provide debt relief 
By revaluing its holdings the IMF may be able to sell billions of dollars of gold and use the cash to cancel debts owed by the world's poorest nations 
The plan was put forward by finance ministers over the weekend 
The price of gold fell to an ounce in Asia before rebounding slightly in early European trading 
IMF boss Rodrigo Rato was asked by ministers to carry out study into the feasibility of revaluing and selling gold reserves 
He is expected to present his conclusions at an IMF meeting in Washington during April 
Whatever happens the market is going to be disconcerted and on the back foot until the April IMF meetings said John Reade an analyst at UBS 
The IMF values its gold reserves at between and an ounce price that was fixed in the and is about tenth of the metal's current market value 
The IMF has tonnes of gold or about ounces 
Bringing the book price of the gold in line with market value would boost the IMF's balance sheet giving it more money to distribute 
This idea has been put forward before but there now seems to be more committed political drive to address the issue of global poverty 
This is the first time there has been mention of the use of gold in communiqu for achieving debt relief said UK Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown 
At their meeting in London finance ministers backed plans to write off up to of the debts owed by some of the world's poorest countries 
Mr Brown said the meeting would be remembered as the debt relief summit 
While debt relief seems to have jumped to the top of the global agenda not everyone is convinced that selling IMF gold is the best way forward 
The US which can veto any plan to sell IMF gold should it so choose said it is looking at other ways of solving the problem 
The US is not convinced that's the necessary way to do it said Treasury Under Secretary John Taylor 
Canada key gold producer also expressed reservations

The paper said Chinese officials had been irritated by Rover's disclosure of its talks with Shanghai Automotive Industry Corp in October 
The proposed deal was seen as crucial to safeguarding the future of Rover's Longbridge plant in the West Midlands

US Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan has given speech at Scottish church in honour of the pioneering economist Adam Smith 
He delivered the th Adam Smith Lecture in Kirkcaldy Fife 
The Adam Smith Lecture celebrates the author of 's Wealth of Nations which became bible of capitalism 
Dr Greenspan was invited by Chancellor Gordon Brown whose minister father John used to preach at the St Bryce Kirk church 
Mr Brown introduced Dr Greenspan to the invited guests as the the world's greatest economist 
Dr Greenspan who has been in the UK to attend the meeting in London said the world could never repay the debt of gratitude it owed to Smith whose genius he compared to that of Mozart 
He said the philosopher was towering contributor to the modern world 
Kirkcaldy the birthplace in of Adam Smith and by extension of modern economics is also of course where your chancellor was reared 
am led to ponder to what extent the chancellor's renowned economic and financial skills are the result of exposure to the subliminal intellect-enhancing emanation in this area 
He continued Smith reached far beyond the insights of his predecessors to frame global view of how market economics just then emerging worked 
In so doing he supported changes in societal organisation that were to measurably enhance standards of living 

Dr Greenspan said Smith's revolutionary philosophy on human self-interest laissez-faire economics and competition had been force for good in the world 
The incredible insights of handful of intellectuals of the Enlightenment especially with Smith toiling in the environs of Kirkcaldy created the modern vision of people free to choose and to act according to their individual self-interest he said 
Following his lecture Dr Greenspan who received an honorary knighthood from the Queen at Balmoral in was awarded an honorary fellowship of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 
He later opened an exhibition dedicated to Smith in the atrium of Fife College of Further and Higher Education 
Joyce Johnston principal of the college said It is very fitting that the world's premier economist delivered this lecture in tribute to the world's first economist 
Dr Greenspan who became chairman of the Federal Reserve for an unprecedented fifth term in June will step down in January next year 
He has served under Presidents George Bush Bill Clinton George Bush and Ronald Reagan 
He was also chairman of the council of economic advisors to Gerald Ford

UK businesses are set to prosper during the next few months but this could trigger more interest rate rises according to report 
Optimism is at its highest since and business will reap the benefits of continuing rise in public spending say researchers at BDO Stoy Hayward 
The Bank of England is expected to keep rates on hold this week but they could go up later in the year 
Rates are likely to rise after the anticipated general election in May 
The BDO optimism index leading indicator of GDP growth two quarters ahead edged up in January to from in October 
The rise is due in part to an increase in public spending and increased merger and acquisition activity 
The only thing blighting business optimism this year will be uncertainties associated with the general election BDO said

The US stock market watchdog's chairman has said he is willing to soften tough new US corporate governance rules to ease the burden on foreign firms 
In speech at the London School of Economics William Donaldson promised several initiatives 
European firms have protested that US laws introduced after the Enron scandal make Wall Street listings too costly 
The US regulator said foreign firms may get extra time to comply with key clause in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act 
The Act comes into force in mid- 
It obliges all firms with US stock market listings to make declarations which critics say will add substantially to the cost of preparing their annual accounts 
Firms that break the new law could face huge fines while senior executives risk jail terms of up to years 
Mr Donaldson said that although the Act does not provide exemptions for foreign firms the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC would continue to be sensitive to the need to accomodate foreign structures and requirements 
There are few if any who disagree with the intentions of the Act which obliges chief executives to sign statement taking responsibility for the accuracy of the accounts 
But European firms with secondary listings in New York have objected arguing that the compliance costs outweigh the benefits of dual listing 
The Act also applies to firms with more than US shareholders situation many firms without US listings could find themselves in 
The -shareholder threshold has drawn anger as it effectively blocks the most obvious remedy delisting 
Mr Donaldson said the SEC would consider whether there should be new approach to the deregistration process for foreign firms unwilling to meet US requirements 
We should seek solution that will preserve investor protections without turning the US market into one with no exit he said 
He revealed that his staff were already weighing up the merits of delaying the implementation of the Act's least popular measure Section for foreign firms 
Seen as particularly costly to implement Section obliges chief executives to take responsibility for the firm's internal controls by signing compliance statement in the annual accounts 
The SEC has already delayed implementation of this clause for smaller firms including US ones with market capitalisations below 
delegation of European firms visited the SEC in December to press for change the Financial Times reported 
It was led by Digby Jones director general of the UK's Confederation of British Industry CBI and included representatives of BASF Siemens and Cadbury Schweppes 
Compliance costs are already believed to be making firms wary of US listings 
Air China picked the London Stock Exchange for its secondary listing in its bn stock market debut last month 
There are also rumours that two Chinese state-run banks China Construction Bank and Bank of China have abandoned plans for multi-billion dollar listings in New York later this year 
Instead the cost of Sarbanes-Oxley has persuaded them to stick to single listing in Hong Kong according to press reports in China

Ukraine is to review dozens of state asset sales as the country's new administration tackles corruption 
The figure announced by President Viktor Yushchenko is less than the cases mentioned last week but will cover many of the biggest deals 
Ukraine recently ousted long-serving leader Leonid Kuchma and has said it wants closer European Union links 
In separate statement the EU said that the US should back Ukraine's entry into the World Trade Organisation 
The comments came as Viktor Yushchenko prepared to head to Brussels to meet with US President George Bush and other North Atlantic Treaty Organisation Nato leaders 
He is the only non-Nato member leader invited to attend the summit 
Mr Yushchenko recently defeated Moscow-backed presidential candidate and Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych at the polls and has made no secret of his wish to fight corruption and make Ukraine more transparent 
Earlier this month new Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko said as many as firms may have their privatisations put under the spotlight 
Her comments raised concerns among number of investors and Mr Yushchenko was seen on Monday as trying to soothe their frayed nerves 
We acknowledge that business in Ukraine is now shaped and of privatisations were carried out according to the law Mr Yushchenko said on Monday 
We have trust in this business and want to defend it by law he continued adding that any review would focus on dozens of companies not hundreds or thousands 
He cited last year's sale of Ukrainian steel producer Krivorizhstal as one that had raised concerns 
It was sold in June to consortium that included Viktor Pinchuk son-in-law of former-President Kuchma and Rinat Akhmetov the country's richest man for despite other higher offers 
Vice-Prime Minister Oleg Rybachuk called on the EU to recognise the steps that Ukraine was taking fearing that should the country not be rewarded for its efforts there may be backlash against closer relations with Brussels 
He said that while he understood that Ukraine was not ready for EU membership the country needed to see progress on topics such as trade and visa requirements 
We deserve an honest response Mr Rybachuk told the Associated Press in an interview 
We understand the difficulties 
We refuse to understand double standards 
Ukraine may find it has sympathetic ear in Brussels The EU has reiterated that we support Ukraine's fast accession to the WTO and if possible we would like that to happen some time during the year said Claude Veron-Reville spokesman for EU trade commissioner Peter Mandelson 
We have said as much to the Americans 
We feel that it is important for us all to pull together for Ukraine to be allowed into the WTO 
Mr Yushchenko was careful not to turn his back on Russia which borders the country to the east saying it was important to maintain 'pragmatic' ties with Moscow 
Russia is Ukraine's eternal strategic partner Mr Yushchenko said

Standard Life is the latest shareholder in Deutsche Boerse to express concern at the German stock market operator's plans to buy the London Stock Exchange 
It said Deutsche Boerse had to show why its planned bn bn offer for the LSE was good for shareholder value 
Reports say Standard Life which owns stake in Deutsche Boerse may seek shareholder vote on the issue 
Fellow shareholders US-based hedge fund Atticus Capital and UK-based TCI Fund Management have also expressed doubts 
Deutsche Boerse's supervisory board has approved the possible takeover of the LSE despite the signs of opposition from investors 
The onus is on Deutsche Boerse's management to demonstrate why the purchase of the LSE creates more value for shareholders than other strategies such as buyback said Richard Moffat investment director of UK Equities at Standard Life Investments 
Atticus Capital holding of Deutsche Boerse wants it to buy back its own shares rather than buy the LSE 
And TCI which holds about has made request for an extraordinary shareholders meeting to be held to vote on replacing the company's entire supervisory board 
It has also demanded that shareholders be consulted about the proposed acquisition and whether the operator of the Frankfurt stock exchange should return to shareholders instead 
In December Deutsche Boerse which also owns the derivatives market Eurex and the clearing firm Clearstream put an informal offer of pence per LSE share on the table 
However the LSE said the cash offer undervalued both its own business and the benefits of such tie-up 
Since then an improved offer from Deutsche Boerse has been anticipated as its management has continued talks with LSE chief executive Clara Furse 
But the London exchange is also holding talks with Deutsche Boerse's rival Euronext which operates the Amsterdam Brussels Lisbon and Paris exchanges as well as London-based international derivatives market Liffe

Lord Browne pointed out that BP was reaping the benefits of its investment in oil exploration 
We have spent many years buying assets when the price is low he said 
The company has made new discoveries in Egypt the Gulf of Mexico and Angola 
However Lord Browne rejected calls for windfall tax on his company's huge profits saying that in the North Sea it paid progressively more tax the more profits it made 
Lord Browne believes oil prices will remain quite high 
Currently above barrel he said The price of oil will be well supported above barrel for the medium term

International oil and mining companies have reacted cautiously to Russia's decision to bar foreign firms from natural resource tenders in 
US oil giant Exxon said it did not plan to take part in new tender on project for which it had previously signed preliminary agreement 
Miner Highland Gold said it regretted any limit on privatisation while BP big investor declined to comment 
Only firms at least Russian-owned will be permitted to bid 
The Federal Natural Resources Agency said the government is interested in letting Russian companies develop strategic resources 
The foreign ownership issue will be dealt with according to Russia's competition law natural resources minister Yuri Trutnev was quoted as saying by the Interfax news agency 
No further details were given with Mr Trutnev suggesting that Russia may decide on case-by-case basis 
Observers said that the move may represent shift in policy as the administration of Vladimir Putin puts the protection of national interests above free market dynamics 
Russia recently wrested back control of large chunk of its oil industry from stock-market listed company Yukos move that prompted calls of outrage from many investors 
Analysts warned that it was still too early to draw too many conclusions from this new set of proposals 
Companies echoed this sentiment saying that they would require more information before ringing the alarm bells 
It's not good 
But it is very understandable said Al Breach an economist at UBS Brunswick 
But if the investment climate is stable that's much more important 
Foreigners of course would like to have free entry but 
this is not the end of the world 
number of other nations including Mexico Saudi Arabia and Kuwait protect their national resources from foreign firms 
What has surprised observers is that since the collapse of communism Russia has been courting foreign investment 
BP spent bn to create Russian-registered oil company TNK-BP and has partnership to develop the Sakhalin petroleum field with state-owned Rosneft 
Exxon the world's largest oil company has signed preliminary agreements to develop the Sakhalin field 
Company spokesman Glenn Waller said Exxon still considered the deal valid despite Russia inviting new offers for the land block 
According to Mr Waller Exxon were not planning to bid at new tender anyway 
We regret the ministry has taken such decision said Ivan Kulakov deputy chairman of Highland Gold mining firm that has the motto Bringing Russia's Gold to Market 
It would be shame if that has negative impact on the investment climate 
Other firms that have been linked with investment in Russia include France's Total the US-based ChevronTexaco and miner Barrick Gold

Manchester United's board has agreed to give US tycoon Malcolm Glazer access to its books 
Earlier this month Mr Glazer presented the board with detailed proposals on an offer to buy the football club 
In statement the club said it would allow Mr Glazer limited due diligence to give him the opportunity to take the proposal on to formal bid 
But it said it continued to oppose Mr Glazer's plans calling his assumptions aggressive and his plan damaging 
Many of Manchester United's supporters own shares in the club and the fan-based group Shareholders United is strongly opposed to any takeover by Mr Glazer 
About fans protested outside the Old Trafford ground two days ago 
Rival local club Manchester City has pleaded with visiting fans not to protest inside its ground when the two teams play televised match on Sunday 
Manchester United's response comes as little surprise as the board made clear 
Any board has responsibility to consider bona fide offer proposal the club said in its statement 
Should it become firm offer it should be at price that the board is likely to regard as fair and on terms which may be deliverable 
But it also stressed that it stayed opposed to Mr Glazer's proposal 
The board continues to believe that Mr Glazer's business plan assumptions are aggressive the statement said and the direct and indirect financial strain on the business could be damaging 
Whether or not the bid is attractive in monetary terms in the case of Manchester United many investors hold the stock for sentimental rather than financial reasons 
At present Mr Glazer and his family hold stake making them Manchester United's second biggest shareholders 
They own the successful Tampa Bay Buccaneers American football team based in Florida 
If the family makes formal offer they will need the support of the club's biggest shareholders 
Irish horse racing millionaires JP McManus and John Magnier own of United through their investment vehicle Cubic Expression and have yet to express view on the bid approach 
group of five MPs are calling on the Department of Trade and Industry to block any takeover of the club by the US football magnate on public interest grounds 
They have signed House of Commons motion and Tony Lloyd the Manchester Central MP whose constituency includes the club's Old Trafford ground has pledged to take the matter to Tony Blair if necessary 
The Commons motion says any takeover designed to transform the club into private company would be against the interests of those supporters and football 
However the DTI has dismissed the proposal 
spokesman said the department did not believe there was case for changing the Enterprise Act so that takeovers of football clubs could be looked at on non-competition grounds 
Mr Glazer's offer values the club at bn 
Pitched at per share it also relies less on debt to finance it than an earlier approach from the US tycoon which was rejected out of hand

The January sales have failed to help the UK High Street recover from poor Christmas season survey has found 
Stores received boost from bargain hunters but trading then reverted to December levels the British Retail Consortium and accountants KPMG said 
Sales in what is traditionally strong month rose by on like-for-like basis compared with year earlier 
Consumers remain cautious over buying big-ticket items like furniture said BRC director general Kevin Hawkins 
Higher interest rates and uncertainty over the housing market continue to take their toll on the retail sector the BRC said 
But clothing and footwear sales were said to be generally better than December while department stores also had good month 
In the three-months to January like-for-like sales showed growth rate of the same as in the three months to December the BRC said 
Following relatively strong New Year's bank holiday trading then took downward turn said Mr Hawkins 
Even extending some promotions and discounts and the pay-day boost later in the month could not tempt customers 
The previous BRC survey found Christmas was the worst for years for retailers 
And according to Office for National Statistics data sales in December failed to meet expectations and by some counts were the worst since

They can complain about it but it is curtains for them 
They may not want him but they are going to get him 
The US tycoon who has been wooing the club for the last months has approached the United board with detailed proposals it has confirmed

Venezuela is to review all foreign investment in its mining industries in an effort to strengthen its indigenous industrial output 
President Hugo Chavez has ordered all existing contracts with foreign firms to be examined to see if they provide maximum benefits to the country 
The review will cover production of gold aluminium and iron ore although it excludes the country's oil sector 
Chavez has sought to extend the state's role in all sectors of the economy 
The left-wing president is conducting controversial review of land ownership in the country while also seeking to create state-run telecoms firm to compete with foreign-owned businesses 
He has argued that major economic reforms are vital to improve the lives of Venezuela's poorest citizens 
Announcing the review of raw material production minister Victor Alvarez said the government would seek to transfer technology training capability and content from projects with foreign partners 
We are defending our national sovereignty over the use of our national resources which must serve the endogenous development of the nation Mr Alvarez said 
For this reason we are reviewing all memorandums of understanding all letters of intent all agreements that have been signed all contracts to check which of these comply with these directives 
Everything absolutely everything has to be reviewed 

Venezuela has previously assured foreign companies with operations in the mineral rich country that it respects existing contracts 
However the government insisted that it needed to develop its own industrial infrastructure in order to create new jobs and lessen its reliance on foreign partners 
If we don't do this we are just going to carry on being slaves suppliers of raw materials all our lives and we will never develop our own productive capacity Mr Alvarez added 
Companies from the United States Canada France and Switzerland all have substantial investments in Venezuela's mining sector

The head of Lloyd's of London the insurance market has criticised Britain's financial watchdog the Financial Services Authority FSA 
In speech on Monday Mr Prettejohn urged the FSA to force brokers to disclose the size of their commissions 
The FSA should change and change now said Mr Prettejohn who wants it to move from disclosure on request to mandatory disclosure 
The call came in speech on improving the London insurance market 
The FSA should not bide their time and 'wait and see' 
They should seize the moment Mr Prettejohn Lloyd's chief executive said 
The FSA took over regulation of the general insurance sector in January but it sidestepped calls to require brokers to disclose the commissions they earn from insurers to their clients 
Last week the City watchdog gave brokers and insurers guidance on managing conflicts of interest 
Brokers must give information on their commissions if and only if their customers request it the FSA said 
In the US lack of transparency about brokers' commissions has led to problems 
The world's biggest insurance broker Marsh McLennan said last week it would pay to settle charges raised by New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer in October that it sought to rig bids in conjunction with insurers 
The probe centred around so-called contingent commissions whereby brokers were rewarded according to how much business they brought to an insurer an arrangement that did not always benefit brokers' customers 
All of the insurance business written in the Lloyd's market is placed via brokers

Male life expectancy is much higher than originally estimated leading pension researchers have said 
The Pensions Policy Institute PPI said life expectancy for unskilled and professional men has been understated 
Life expectancy at birth is years for manual worker and years for professional gap of eight years 
But if measured at age instead the PPI said manual worker will live to years and professional worker to years gap of just five years 
The PPI's estimate is higher because it excludes people who have died before they reach years of age and also takes into account ongoing improvements in life expectancy 
The government has ruled out raising the state pension age because it says it would penalise lower-skilled workers who generally have lower life expectancies 
Chris Curry PPI research director said its calculations suggested there could be more pressure on state pension spending than originally envisaged 
Even people in social class unskilled manual workers who are widely likely to have the lowest life expectancy can still expect to live years after state pension age he said 
Researchers have not updated life expectancy projections for women who on average live longer than men

New safeguards on credit and debit card payments in shops has led fraudsters to focus on internet and phone payments an anti-fraud agency has said 
Anti-fraud consultancy Retail Decisions says 'card-not-present' fraud where goods are paid for online or by phone has risen since the start of 
The introduction of 'chip and pin' cards has tightened security for transactions on the High Street 
But the clampdown has caused fraudsters to change tack Retail Decisions said 
The introduction of chip and pin cards aimed to cut down on credit card fraud in stores by asking shoppers to verify their identity with confidential personal pin number instead of signature 
Retail Decisions chief executive Carl Clump told the BBC that there was no doubt that chip and pin would reduce card fraud in the card-present environment 
However it is important to monitor what happens in the card-not-present environment as fraudsters will turn their attention to the internet mail order telephone order and interactive TV he said 
We have seen uplift in card-not-present fraud here in the UK 
since the start of the year 
Fraud doesn't just disappear it mutates to the next weakest link in the chain he said 
Retail Decisions' survey on the implementation of chip and pin found that shoppers had adapted easily to the new system but that banks' performance in distributing the new cards had been patchy at best 
The main issue is that not everyone has the pins they need said Mr Clump 
Nearly two thirds of the people interviewed said they had used chip and pin to make payments 
Of these were happy with the experience though nearly quarter said they struggled to remember their pin number 
However only said they had received replacement cards with the necessary 'chip' technology from all their card providers

Employers have spent billions of pounds propping up their final salary pensions over the past year research suggests 
survey of schemes by Incomes Data Services' IDS said employer contributions had increased from bn to bn year rise of 
Companies facing the biggest deficits had raised their pension contributions by or more IDS said 
Many firms are struggling to keep this type of scheme open because of rising costs and increased liabilities 
final salary scheme also known as defined benefit scheme promises to pay pension related to the salary the scheme member is earning when they retire 
The rising cost of maintaining such schemes has led many employers to replace final salary schemes with money purchase or defined contribution schemes 
These are less risky for employers 
Under money purchase schemes employees pay into pension fund which is used to buy an annuity policy which pays out an income until death on retirement 
IDS said there were some schemes in good health 
But in many cases firms had been forced to top up funds to tackle yawning deficits 
The level of contributions paid by employers has increased gradually since the late 
In for example contributions rose by and in by 
In contrast between and some employers cut their contribution levels 
Helen Sudell editor of the IDS Pensions Service said the rise in contributions was staggering and the highest ever recorded by IDS 
We have warned before that the widespread closure of final salary schemes to new entrants is just the beginning of much bigger movement away from paternalistic provision said Ms Sudell 
With figures like this there can be little doubt that many employers will have to reduce future benefits at some point for those staff still in these schemes

UK businesses are set to prosper during the next few months but this could trigger more interest rate rises according to report 
Optimism is at its highest since and business will reap the benefits of continuing rise in public spending say researchers at BDO Stoy Hayward 
The Bank of England is expected to keep rates on hold this week but they could go up later in the year 
Rates are likely to rise after the anticipated general election in May 
The BDO optimism index leading indicator of GDP growth two quarters ahead edged up in January to from in October 
The rise is due in part to an increase in public spending and increased merger and acquisition activity 
The only thing blighting business optimism this year will be uncertainties associated with the general election BDO said 
Its BDO's output index which predicts GDP movements quarter in advance remained at for January implying GDP growth at in the second quarter of

finance ministers have backed plans to write off up to of the debts of some of the world's poorest countries 
UK chancellor Gordon Brown said the London meeting of the world's seven richest nations would be remembered as the debt relief summit 
Some countries could benefit after case-by-case review by bodies including the World Bank and the IMF he said 
But the US says it cannot support Mr Brown's International Finance Facility to boost aid to developing countries 
BBC correspondents said the meeting had produced some movement towards the UK's ambitions but much work was needed 
Mr Brown said it was major breakthrough for the international organisations to offer up to multilateral debt relief the vast bulk of money owed by the poorest countries 
We could be at the beginning of the final stage of the process where the debts that were owed by the poorest countries built up over or years debts that are simply unpayable in the real world are finally taken care of he said 
He added It is the richest countries hearing the voices of the poor 
But he said they would insist on government reforms and the need for transparency tackling corruption and openness from both the poorest and richest nations 
BBC correspondent Patrick Bartlett said while it was an agreement in principle the organisations involved now have to look at how it would work in practice 
Oxfam senior policy adviser Max Lawson welcomed the statement and said ministers had passed the first hurdle of 
But he added They need to move quickly to turn their proposals into real change for the world's poorest

Mr Brown wanted to provide bn bn year over decade using backing so the money could be borrowed up front on financial markets 
It is key element of his proposals for modern version of the Marshall Plan which brought US aid to rebuild Europe after World War II for the developing world 
Mr Brown said it was winning support every day and said programme had been agreed to draw up more details in time for the summit in July 
But US Treasury Under-Secretary John Taylor said the US could not support the IFF because of its legislative process 
The US is completely committed to poverty reduction and providing financing to do that he said 
But this particular mechanism does not work for the United States 
It works for other countries and that is fine 
Earlier he told BBC Radio 's Today programme the US had increased support for Africa in the past four years from bn per year to bn per year 
But South Africa Finance Minister Trevor Manuel told the BBC's Talking Point programme what was needed was one approach with all wealthy nations on board

The battle for control of Manchester United has taken another turn after the club confirmed it had received fresh takeover approach from US business tycoon Malcolm Glazer 
No formal offer has been made yet but Manchester United have confirmed they have received detailed proposal from the US entrepreneur which could lead to bid 
Reports have put the offer at per share which would value Manchester United at about bn 
The approach by the -year-old owner of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers American football team is reportedly being led by his two sons Avi and Joel 
previous approach to the United board by Mr Glazer in October last year was turned down 
However the BBC has learnt that the club is unlikely to reject the latest plan out of hand 
Mr Glazer's previous offer involved borrowing large amounts of money to finance any takeover 
That would have left the club with debt levels which were deemed not 
in the best interests of the company by Manchester United's board when they rejected his approach last year 
However Mr Glazer's latest offer is reported to have cut the amount of borrowing needed by 
While United's board may be casting serious eye over Mr Glazer's latest proposals supporters remain fiercely opposed to any deal 
Supporters' group Shareholders United which has proved adept in rallying opposition to Mr Glazer's campaign said it would fight any move 
Manchester United are debt-free company 
We don't want to fall into debt and we don't need to fall into debt Shareholders United's Sean Bones told the BBC 
United's players also appear unhappy at the prospect of takeover 
lot of people want the club's interest to be with people who have grown up with the club and got its interests at heart Rio Ferdinand told BBC Radio Five Live 
No-one knows what this guy will be bringing to the table 

The key to any successful bid will be attracting the support of United's largest shareholders the Irish horse racing tycoons John Magnier and JP McManus 
Through their Cubic Expression vehicle they own of the club 
Mr Glazer owns 
Joe McLean football specialist at accountancy firm Grant Thornton said the support of Mr Magnier and Mr McManus was utterly crucial 
Mr Glazer's bid will not proceed without their support and they have previously indicated that they are holding their stake as an investment 
If that's the case the shares will therefore need price attachment of about pence maybe 
If that's the case then Mr Glazer might well secure their support if he does this bid could well go ahead 

Indeed it is 
Malcolm Glazer was little-known in the UK until he started to build up his stake in Manchester United in late 
In February he said he was considering whether to bid for the club 
No bid emerged but Mr Glazer continued to increase his holding in the club 
In October Manchester United said they had received preliminary approach which turned out to have come from Mr Glazer 
However the board rejected the move because of the amount of debt it would involve 
At the club's annual general meeting in November Mr Glazer took revenge by using his hefty stake in the club to oust three directors from the board 
Legal adviser Maurice Watkins commercial director Andy Anson and non-executive director Philip Yea were voted out against the wishes of chief executive David Gill 
But the move led to bankers JP Morgan and public relations firm Brunswick withdrawing from the Glazer bid team

Our mission to brighten up your working lives continues and this time we're taking long hard look at your offices 
Over the next few months our panel of experts will be listening to your gripes about where you work and suggesting ways to make your workspace more efficient more congenial or simply prettier 
This week we're hearing from Marianne Petersen who is planning to convert barn in Sweden into base for her freelance writing work 
Click on the link under her photograph to read her story and then scroll down to see what the panel have to say 
And if you want to take part in the series go to the bottom of the story to find out how to get in touch 
Working from home presents multitude of challenges 
Understanding your work personality allows you to work in terms of your own style 
Do you feel confident about your work output without conferring with others 
Are you able to retain discipline and self motivate to get the job done 
Do you build on the ideas of others or are you more introspective problem solver 
In order for virtual office to succeed keeping the boundary between work and home life is essential 
It may be useful to be quite rigid about who is allowed to visit and to keep strict office hours 
Referring to the space as work will give those around you clear message that this is professional space 
It is imperative to consider how to bring the outside world into yours keeping up to date with developments and maintaining network 
Isolated work environments mean this has to be carefully thought out and strategy has to be developed that suits both your personality and your industry 
Joining professional groups or forming loose association of like-minded people may assist 
It is useful to structure these meetings in advance as often they get relegated to less important status when times are busy with the danger that when the workload eases they have to be resurrected 
Prior to any interior work being undertaken it is essential to ensure that the roof and walls are made water-and-weather-tight and the structure is checked for stability 
It appears that the roof trusses may need repairs and additional bracing 
Ideally the roof should be replaced with an outer material in keeping with the character and location of the barn 
This would also allow for well-insulated inner skin to be provided which should be light coloured 
It is likely that the most efficient way of heating the building is with electricity 
In order to provide this the owner will need to have an electrical engineer calculate the potential heating power and lighting load to make sure the mains supply and distribution capacity are adequate 
Ideally it would be good to have mains water supply and some means of drainage for toilet and washing facilities 
The walls should be dry lined with single skin of plasterboard laid over rockwool slab which will allow good wall insulation and the power and lighting circuits to be concealed and the walls should be painted in light colour 
The owner mentions she might lay new floor over the existing planks this will improve the insulation and offer level surface 
would suggest laying new oak veneer planks which can work in with the character of the barn 
As for lighting consider combination of floor mounted uplights wall lights wall washers and selected downlights 
Use combination of mains voltage fluorescent fittings and dimmable units which can vary the light levels and the feel of the interior 
Please click on the link to the right here to see my ideas for Marianne's barn 
The layout of this office reflects the need to have working area and more relaxed meeting space 
Large desk space and extensive storage would combine with tub chairs to maximise the space available 
The finishes chosen for the furniture will need to reflect the unusual setting while the lighting and temperature control mechanisms used will further influence the workplace 
Regarding accessing the internet via the connection in the main house your plan of going wireless is sensible 
wireless router access point in the house with wireless LAN card in the PC in the renovated area may be sufficient 
However important points to consider are the distance between the two buildings and the nature of the materials through which the signals have to pass which could result in weak signal strength 
You may require an additional wireless access point in the renovated area 
Your local IT supplier will be able to advise on this 
If you haven't already invested in robust firewall and anti-virus software it is essential to do so to protect your investment 
To really take advantage of wireless technology you might consider laptop computer and docking station with external mouse and monitor 
Or you could use one of the new Tablet computers which allow you to write directly on the screen and convert into text with built-in hand recognition software 
And finally you will save money and space by considering multi-function product for print scan copy and fax

It was clearly source of uncertainty for the company it was long cruise after all 
But the stock market is very good at treating these issues as one-off events 

Despite its string of bad luck he pointed out Aurora is just one vessel in large Carnival fleet the UK's Princess group having been merged into the much larger US firm in 
And generally speaking Carnival has reputation for keeping its ships pretty much on schedule 
Carnival has an incredibly strong track record Mr Champion 
Similarly analysts expect the impact on the rest of the cruise business to be limited 
The hundreds of disappointed passengers who have now had to give up the opportunity to spend the next three months on the Aurora have got both refund and credit for another cruise 
That should mitigate some of the PR risk both for Carnival and its main competitor Royal Caribbean 
While not common cancellations for technical reasons are not entirely unusual in the industry wrote analysts from Citigroup Smith Barney in note to clients on Friday 
Moreover such events typically have limited impact on bookings and pricing for future cruises 
After all the Aurora incident may be big news in the UK but for Carnival customers elsewhere it's unlikely to make too much of splash 
Assuming that Citigroup is right and demand stays solid the structure of the industry also works in Carnival's favour 
In the wake of Princess's takeover by Carnival the business is now to great extent duopoly 
Given the expense of building outfitting and running cruise ship slowing supply growth is certainty said David Anders at Merrill Lynch on Thursday 
In other words if you do want cruise your options are limited 
And with Carnival remaining the market leader it looks set to keep selling the tickets no matter what happens to the ill-fated Aurora in the future

The budget proposals laid out by the administration of US President George Bush are highly controversial 
The Washington-based Economic Policy Institute which tends to be critical of the President looks at possible fault lines 
US politicians and citizens of all political persuasions are in for dose of shock therapy 
Without major changes in current policies and political prejudices the federal budget simply cannot hold together 
News coverage of the Bush budget will be dominated by debates about spending cuts but the fact is these will be large cuts in small programs 
From the standpoint of the big fiscal trends the cuts are gratuitous and the big budget train wreck is yet to come 
Under direct threat will be the federal government's ability to make good on its debts to the Social Security Trust Fund 
As soon as the fund will begin to require some cash returns on its bond holdings in order to finance all promised benefits 
The trigger for the coming shock will be rising federal debt which will grow in years by conservative estimates to more than half the nation's total annual output 
This upward trend will force increased borrowing by the federal government putting upward pressure on interest rates faced by consumers and business 
Even now growing share of US borrowing is from abroad 
The US Government cannot finance its operations without heavy borrowing from the central banks of Japan and China among other nations 
This does not bode well for US influence in the world 
The decline of the dollar is warning sign that current economic trends cannot continue 
The dollar is already sinking 
Before too long credit markets are likely to react and interest rates will creep upwards 
That will be the shock 
Interest-sensitive industries will feel pain immediately sectors such as housing automobiles other consumer durables agriculture and small business 
Some will recall the news footage of angry farmers driving their heavy equipment around the US Capitol in the late 
There will be no need for constitutional amendments to balance the budget 
The public outcry will force Congress to act 
Whether it will act wisely is another matter 
How did this happen 
By definition the deficit means too little revenue and too much spending but this neutral description doesn't adequately capture the current situation 
Federal revenues are at levels while spending remains where it has been in recent decades much higher 
In addition the United States has two significant military missions 
The Bush administration's chosen remedy is the least feasible one 
Reducing domestic spending or eliminating waste fraud and abuse is toothless because this slice of the budget is too small to solve the problem 
Indeed if Congress were rash enough to balance the budget in this way there would hardly be any such spending left 
Law enforcement space exploration environmental clean-up economic development the Small Business Administration housing veterans' benefits aid to state and local governments would all but disappear 
It's fantasy to think these routine government functions could be slashed 
The biggest spending growth areas are defence including homeland security and health care for the elderly and the poor 
To some extent increases in these areas are inevitable 
The US population is aging and the nation does face genuine threats in the world 
But serious savings can only be found where the big money is 
Savings in health care spending that do not come at the expense of health can only be achieved with wholesale reform of the entire system public and private 
Brute force budget cuts or spending caps would ill-serve the nation's elderly and indigent 
On the revenue side the lion's share of revenue lost to tax cuts enacted since will have to be replaced 
Some rearranging could hold many people harmless and focus most of the pain on those with relatively high incomes 
Finally blind allegiance to balanced budget will have to be abandoned 
There is no good reason to fixate on it anyway 
Moderate deficits and slowly rising federal debt can be sustained indefinitely 
Borrowing for investments in education and infrastructure that pay off in future years makes sense 
The sooner we face that reality the sooner workable reforms can be pursued 
First on the list should be tax reform to raise revenue simplify the tax code and restore some fairness eroded by the Bush tax cuts 
Second should be dispassionate re-evaluation of the huge increase in defence spending over the past three years much of it unrelated to Afghanistan Iraq or terrorism 
Third must be the start of serious debate on large-scale health care reform 
One thing is certain destroying the budget in order to save it is not going to equip the US economy and government for the challenges of this new century

Giving evidence in the criminal trial of Mr Ebbers ex-finance chief Scott Sullivan implicated his colleague in the accounting scandal at the firm 
Mr Sullivan WorldCom's former number two is the government's chief witness in its case against Mr Ebbers 
Mr Ebbers has denied multiple charges of conspiracy and fraud 
Senior WorldCom executives are accused of orchestrating huge fraud at the former telecoms company in which they exaggerated revenues and hid the cost of expenses 
The firm was forced into bankruptcy the largest in US history 
Mr Sullivan pleaded guilty to fraud last year and agreed to assist the government with its case against Mr Ebbers 
Prosecutors have alleged that Mr Ebbers directed Mr Sullivan to hide the true state of the company's finances by providing false information to the firm's accountants 
Mr Ebbers has denied all the charges saying he was unaware of the fraud 
His lawyers claim that their client was unfamiliar with detailed accounting practices and left that side of the business to Mr Sullivan 
However on Monday Mr Sullivan named Mr Ebbers as one of five executives who participated in the accounting fraud 
He Ebbers has got hands-on grasp of financial information Mr Sullivan told New York court 
On his first day of questioning Mr Sullivan admitted to falsifying the company's financial statements 
We did not disclose these adjustments he said 
We did not talk about these adjustments and the information was false 
Mr Sullivan said his former boss knew more about accounting matters than many chief financial officers and described him as detail-oriented 
He portrayed Mr Ebbers charismatic businessman who built up WorldCom from small regional operator into one of America's largest telecoms firms as obsessed with costs 
He would talk about that there were more coffee filters than coffee bags and that means employees are taking coffee home he said 
We needed to cut expenses 
We needed to cut lot more than coffee expenses 
Mr Sullivan is at the centre of the government's case against Mr Ebbers 
Mr Ebbers could face sentence of years if convicted of all the charges he is facing

President Bush has presented his budget cutting domestic spending in bid to lower record deficit projected to peak at bn bn this year 
The trillion trillion budget submitted to Congress affects domestic programmes from farming to the environment education and health 
But foreign aid is due to rise by with more money to treat HIV Aids and reward economic and political reform 
Military spending is also set to rise by to reach bn 
The budget does not include the cost of running military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan for which the administration is expected to seek an extra bn from Congress later this year 
Congress will spend several months debating George Bush's proposal 
The state department's planned budget would rise to just under bn fraction of the defence department's request including almost bn to assist US allies in the war on terror 
However the administration is keen to highlight its global effort to tackle HIV Aids the BBC's Jonathan Beale reports and planned spending would almost double to bn with much of that money going to African nations 
Mr Bush also wants to increase the amount given to poorer countries through his Millennium Challenge Corporation 
The scheme has been set up to reward developing countries that embrace what the US considers to be good governance and sound policies 
Yet Mr Bush's proposed spending of bn on that project is well below his initial promise of bn 
key spending line missing from proposals is the cost of funding the administration's proposed radical overhaul of Social Security the pensions programme on which many Americans rely for their retirement income 
Some experts believe this could require borrowing of up to trillion over -year period 
Neither does the budget include any cash to purchase crude oil for the US emergency petroleum stockpile 
Concern over the level of the reserve created in has led to rises in oil prices over the past year 
The Bush administration will instead continue to fill the reserve by taking oil rather than cash from energy companies that drill under federal leases 
The outline proposes reductions in budgets at out of government agencies including cuts of at Agriculture and at the Environmental Protection Agency 
The spending plan for the year beginning October is banking on healthy US economy to boost government income by to trillion 
Spending is forecast to grow by to trillion 
But the budget is still the tightest yet under Mr Bush's presidency 
In order to sustain our economic expansion we must continue pro-growth policies and enforce even greater spending restraint across federal government Mr Bush said in his budget message to Congress 
Mr Bush has promised to halve the US's massive budget deficit within five years 
The deficit partly the result of massive tax cuts early in Mr Bush's presidency has been key factor in pushing the US dollar lower 
The independent Congressional Budget Office estimates that the shortfall could shrink to little more than bn by returning to the surpluses seen in the late by 
But its estimates depend on the tax cuts not being made permanent in line with the promise when they were passed that they would sunset or disappear in 
Most Republicans however want them to stay in place 
And the figures also rely on the Social Security trust fund the money set aside to cover the swelling costs of retirement pensions being offset against the main budget deficit

Profits at Chinese computer firm Lenovo have stood still amid slowing demand at home and stiffening competition 
The firm is in the international spotlight after last year signing deal to buy the PC division of personal computer pioneer IBM 
Lenovo's profit for the three months to December was HK US less than up on the year before 
Chinese PC sales have risen by fifth in each of the past two years but are now growing more slowly 
The company is still by far the biggest player in China with more than quarter of the market 
But Western firms such as Dell and Hewlett-Packard are also mounting more solid fight for market share in China and Lenovo's sales were down by revenue to HK bn 
If the bn agreement Lenovo signed with IBM on December goes through it will mark the end of an era 
IBM pioneered the desktop PC market in the early although strategic mis-steps helped lose it its early dominance 
In any case margins in PC market are now wafer thin and profits have been hard to come by for most vendors except direct-sales giant Dell 
But investors have been less than impressed with Lenovo's move designed to take it out of China and further onto the world stage 
Its shares are down since the announcement two months ago largely because of the unprofitability of the unit it is buying 
There have been rumours that the deal could be in trouble because US government agencies fear it could offer China opportunities for industrial espionage 
The reports of the possibility of an investigation into the risk sent Lenovo's shares up in late January

Press reports suggest that Qwest and MCI may reach an agreement as early as next week although rival bids may muddy the waters 
The largest US telephone company Verizon has previously held preliminary merger discussions with MCI Reuters quoted sources as saying 
Consolidation in the US telecommunications industry has picked up in the past few months as companies look to cut costs and boost client bases 
merger between MCI and Qwest would be the fifth billion-dollar telecoms deal since October

BT has moved to pre-empt possible break-up of its business by offering to cut wholesale broadband prices and open its network to rivals 
The move comes after telecom regulator Ofcom said in November that the firm must offer competitors real equality of access to its phone lines 
At the time Ofcom offered BT the choice of change or splitting into two 
Ofcom is carrying out strategic review aimed at promoting greater competition in the UK telecom sector 
BT's competitors have frequently accused it of misusing its status as the former telecoms monopoly and controller of access to many customers to favour its own retail arm 
This latest submission was delivered to the watchdog ahead of deadline for the second phase of its review 
Central to the proposals are plans by BT to offer operators lower wholesale prices faster broadband services and transparent highly-regulated access to BT's local network the former monopoly said in statement 
The United Kingdom has the opportunity to create the most exciting and innovative telecoms market in the world BT chief executive Ben Verwaayen said 
BT has critical role to play and today we are making set of far-reaching proposals towards that framework he said 
BT wants lighter regulation in exchange for the changes as well as the removal of the break-up threat 
The group is to set up new Access Services division with separate board which would include independent members to ensure equal access for rivals to the local loop the copper wires that run between telephone exchanges and households 
The company also unveiled plans to cut the wholesale prices of its most popular broadband product by about from April in areas of high customer demand 
It added that it plans to invest bn in the next five years to create st Century network 
To meet the growing demand for greater bandwidth BT said it would begin trials in April with view to launching higher-speed services nationally from the autumn 
Telecom analysts Ovum welcomed the move saying BT had given lot of ground 
The big question now is whether the industry and particularly Ofcom feels BT's proposals go far enough 
Now the real negotiation begins director of telecoms research Tony Lavender said 
Internet service provider ISP Plus 
net also backed the proposals saying we will be entirely happy if Ofcom accepts them 
BT has been challenged to play fair and its plans will introduce level playing field 
The scenario now is how well people execute their business plans as service provider chief executive Lee Strafford said 
Chris Panayis managing director of ISP Freedom surf said that it would make the situation clearer for business 
think it's the first productive thing we've had from BT he said 
AOL backed the price cuts but said regulation was still needed to ensure level playing field 
This is reminder to Ofcom that as long as BT can change the dynamics of the whole broadband market at will the process of opening up the UK's local telephone network to infrastructure investment and competition remains fragile spokesman said 
Ofcom needs to return to regulation of the wholesale broadband service IPStream and provide more robust rules for local loop unbundling if consumers are to see the benefits of increased competition and infrastructure investment 
More than telecom firms consumer groups and other interested parties are expected to make submissions to the regulator during this consultation phase 
Ofcom is expected to spend the next few weeks examining the proposals before making an announcement within the next few months

The US created fewer jobs than expected in January but fall in jobseekers pushed the unemployment rate to its lowest level in three years 
According to Labor Department figures US firms added only jobs in January 
The gain in non-farm payrolls was below market expectations of new jobs 
Nevertheless it was enough to push down the unemployment rate to its lowest level since September 
The job gains mean that President Bush can celebrate albeit by very fine margin net growth in jobs in the US economy in his first term in office 
He presided over net fall in jobs up to last November's Presidential election the first President to do so since Herbert Hoover 
As result job creation became key issue in last year's election 
However when adding December and January's figures the administration's first term jobs record ended in positive territory 
The Labor Department also said it had revised down the jobs gains in December from to 
Analysts said the growth in new jobs was not as strong as could be expected given the favourable economic conditions 
It suggests that employment is continuing to expand at moderate pace said Rick Egelton deputy chief economist at BMO Financial Group 
We are not getting the boost to employment that we would have got given the low value of the dollar and the still relatively low interest rate environment 
The economy is producing moderate but not satisfying amount of job growth said Ken Mayland president of ClearView Economics 
That means there are limited number of new opportunities for workers

Santa Monica-based Activison is said to be one firm on its takeover list 
Video games are big business the paper quoted Mr Chernin as saying 
We would like to get into it 
The success of products such as Sony's Playstation Microsoft's X-Box and Nintendo's Game Cube have boosted demand for video games 
The days of arcade classics such as Space Invaders Pac-Man and Donkey Kong are long gone 
Today games often have budgets big enough for feature films and look to give gamers as real an experience as possible 
And with their price tags reflecting the heavy investment by development companies video games are proving almost as profitable as they are fun 
Mr Chernin however told the FT that News Corp was finding it difficult to identify suitable target 
We are struggling with the gap between companies like Electronic Arts EA which comes with high price tag and the next tier of companies he explained during conference in Phoenix Arizona 
These may be too focused on one or two product lines 
Activision has stock market capitalisation of about bn bn compared to EA's bn

The UK pension system has been branded inadequate and too complex by leading retirement think-tank 
The Pensions Policy Institute PPI said replacing the state pension with citizen's pension would help tackle inequality and complexity 
The change would see pensions being calculated on length of residency in the UK rather than National Insurance NI contributions 
Reform could reduce poverty by aiding people with broken employment records 
The PPI added that once the state system was reformed the government should look at options to overhaul private and workplace pensions 
The think tank's proposals were made in response to the recent publication of the Pensions Commission's initial report into UK retirement savings 
According to the Pensions Commission's report million working people are not saving enough for their retirement

Inflation has since been tamed and economic prospects are improving

The transition to the new Turkish lira shows clearly that our economy has broken the vicious circle that it was imprisoned in for long years said Sureyya Serdengecti head of the Turkish Central Bank 
The new lira is also the symbol of the stable economy that we dreamed of for long years

And this at time when all sentiment aside insurance costs are already estimated in the tens of billions of dollars and countries around the region are looking at trimming their growth forecasts 
In fact the markets are being perfectly rational 
For start the notional insurance cost of the disaster will have little bearing on corporate bottom lines 
The overwhelming majority of the victims will have had no insurance according to estimates from India only one-quarter of those affected there were wealthy enough to afford insurance and only one-quarter of that group at most will have taken out policies 
Indonesia is likely to have even lower take-up rates 
And where insurance certainly is in place in for example the many tourist complexes affected the costs will be borne in far-away corners of the global reinsurance market rather than landing locally 
Second stock markets do not trade the sort of companies likely to have been damaged 
Most of the biggest companies traded on the soaring Jakarta Stock Exchange are in oil technology and financial services none of which have been hit by the flooding 
Tourist businesses the most likely sufferers are either foreign-owned or too small to have their shares listed 
Those that are listed have suffered Confifi Hotel Holdings small Sri Lankan tourism firm has halved in value this week 
But there are winners as well as losers 
Asian stock markets are heavily inclined towards property and construction companies many of which will be rubbing their hands over the reconstruction opportunities 
In Indonesia shares in state construction companies Adhi Karya and Semen Gresik have jumped sharply this week 
More broadly the academic consensus is that major disasters are largely neutral in their longer-term economic impact 
According to the Natural Hazards Research and Applications Information Center at Colorado State University there is little evidence that disasters are inevitably followed by depression 
The need to find money to replace lost and damaged property is balanced by the beneficial effect of reconstruction activity there is rarely the centre says any sort of rebuilding boom but in most cases sizeable indirect losses are avoided 
study of the Des Moines floods from the Disaster Research Center at the University of Delaware found that of local businesses were no worse off after the disaster and another felt themselves better off 
Although it is commonly assumed on the basis of anecdotal evidence that disasters result in business failures and bankruptcies on large scale our research indicates that most businesses even those that are especially hard-hit do indeed recover the authors concluded 
But disasters have vast psychological impact and markets are driven by psychological factors 
In particular many analysts warn of panic spreading unchecked through the global financial system as investors seek to cover themselves against the unforeseeable effects of unguessable events 
In fact again the risks here are lower than they seem 
Even the costliest natural disaster is rendered minuscule by the global capital market currently trillion and rising 
series of recent shocks the Colorado centre has argued have demonstrated that this seamless global contagion hardly ever happens market tremors rarely translate into economic slumps and economic woes rarely seriously undermine markets 
The trillion-dollar debts of Japan's banks for example have had no effect on stock markets further afield than Tokyo 
And the US stock market was on its way down long before September it rose by during the six months following the attacks 
It is not that the broking community is indifferent to disasters or feelings one Bombay trader said this week 
But the reaction would have been seen if business had been affected 
Business sense probably tends to overrule everything else

Shares in Europe's leading reinsurers and travel firms have fallen as the scale of the damage wrought by tsunamis across south Asia has become apparent 
More than people have been killed following massive underwater earthquake and many of the worst hit areas are popular tourist destinations 
Reisurance firms such as Swiss Re and Munich Re lost value as investors worried about rebuilding costs 
But the disaster has little impact on stock markets in the US and Asia 
Currencies including the Thai baht and Indonesian rupiah weakened as analysts warned that economic growth may slow 
It came at the worst possible time said Hans Goetti Singapore-based fund manager 
The impact on the tourist industry is pretty devastating especially in Thailand 
Travel-related shares dropped in Europe with companies such as Germany's TUI and Lufthansa and France's Club Mediterranne sliding 
Insurers and reinsurance firms were also under pressure in Europe 
Shares in Munich Re and Swiss Re the world's two biggest reinsurers both fell as the market speculated about the cost of rebuilding in Asia 
Zurich Financial Allianz and Axa also suffered decline in value 
However their losses were much smaller reflecting the market's view that reinsurers were likely to pick up the bulk of the costs 
Worries about the size of insurance liabilities dragged European shares down although the impact was exacerbated by light post-Christmas trading 
Germany's benchmark Dax index closed the day points lower at while France's Cac index of leading shares fell points to 
Investors pointed out however that declines probably would be industry specific with the travel and insurance firms hit hardest 
It's still too early for concrete damage figures Swiss Re's spokesman Floiran Woest told Associated Press 
That also has to do with the fact that the damage is very widely spread geographically 

The unfolding scale of the disaster in south Asia had little immediate impact on US shares however 
The Dow Jones index had risen points or to by late morning as analsyts were cheered by more encouraging reports from retailers about post-Christmas sales 
In Asian markets adjustments were made quickly to account for lower earnings and the cost of repairs 
Thai Airways shed almost 
The country relies on tourism for about of its total economy 
Singapore Airlines dropped 
About of Singapore's annual gross domestic product GDP comes from tourism 
Malaysia's budget airline AirAsia fell 
Resort operator Tanco Holdings slumped 
Travel companies also took hit with Japan's Kinki Nippon sliding and HIS dropping 
However the overall impact on Asia's largest stock market Japan's Nikkei was slight 
Shares fell just 
Concerns about the strength of economic growth going forward weighed on the currency markets 
The Indonesian rupiah lost as much as against the US dollar before bouncing back slightly to trade at 
The Thai baht lost against the US currency trading at 
In India where more than people are thought to have died the rupee shed against the dollar Analysts said that it was difficult to predict the total cost of the disaster and warned that share prices and currencies would come under increasing pressure as the bills mounted

Investors who lost money following the split-capital investment trust scandal are to receive compensation the UK's financial watchdog has announced 
Eighteen investment firms involved in the sale of the investments agreed the compensation package with the Financial Services Authority FSA 
Splits were marketed as low-risk way to benefit from rising share prices 
But when the stock market collapsed in the products left thousands of investors out of pocket 
An estimated people took out split-capital funds some investing their life savings in the schemes 
The paying of compensation will be overseen by an independent company the FSA said 
Further details of how investors will be able to claim their share of the compensation package will be announced in the new year 
This should save investors from having to take their case to the Financial Ombudsman Service something no doubt that will be very welcome Rob McIvor FSA spokesman told BBC News 
Agreeing to pay compensation did not mean that the eighteen firms involved were admitting any guilt the FSA added 
Any investor accepting the compensation will have to waive the right to take their case to the Financial Ombudsman Service 
The FSA has been investigating whether investors were misled about the risks posed by split-capital investment trusts 
The FSA's strong investigation team looked into whether fund managers colluded in so-called magic circle in the hope of propping up one another's share prices 
Firms involved were presented with files of evidence detailing taped conversations and over interviews 
In May the FSA was widely reported as having asked firms to pay up to in compensation 
Mr McIvor told the BBC that the final settlement figure was smaller because two unnamed firms had pulled out of the compensation negotiations 
Investors in these two firms may now have to take any compensation claim to the Financial Ombudsman Service or the courts

European stock market Euronext has met with the London Stock Exchange LSE amid speculation that it may be ready to launch cash bid 
Euronext chief Jean-Francois Theodore held talks with LSE boss Clara Furse the day after rival Deutsche Boerse put forward its own bid case 
The German exchange said it had held constructive professional and friendly talks with the LSE 
But Euronext declined to comment after the talks ended on Friday 
Speculation is mounting that the Germans may raise their bid to bn 
Deutsche Boerse previously offered bn which was rejected by the LSE while Euronext is rumoured to have facilities in place to fund bn cash bid 
So far however neither have tabled formal bid 
But deal with either bidder would create the biggest stock market operator in Europe and the second biggest in the world after the New York Stock Exchange 
There was speculation Euronext would use Friday's meeting as an opportunity to take advantage of growing disquiet over Deutsche Boerse's own plans for dominance over the London market 
Unions for Deutsche Boerse staff in Frankfurt has reportedly expressed fears that up to jobs would be moved to London if the takeover is successful 
The works council has expressed concerns that the equities and derivatives trade could be managed from London in the future Reuters news agency reports union source as saying 
German politicians are also said to be angry over the market operator's promise to move its headquarters to London if bid were successful 
Meanwhile LSE shareholders fear that Deutsche Boerse's control over its Clearstream unit the clearing house that processes securities transactions would create monopoly situation 
This would weaken the position of shareholders when negotiating lower transaction fees for share dealings 
LSE and Euronext do not have control over their clearing and settlement operations situation which critics say is more transparent and competitive 
The German group's ownership of Clearstream has been seen as the main stumbling block to London-Frankfurt merger 
Commentators believe Deutsche Boerse which has now formally asked German authorities to approve its plan to buy the LSE may offer to sell Clearstream to gain shareholder approval 
Euronext so far has given little away as to what sweeteners it will offer the LSE Europe's biggest equity market into deal

The US stock market regulator is investigating troubled insurance broker Marsh McLennan's shareholder transactions the firm has said 
The Securities and Exchange Commission has asked for information about transactions involving holders of or more of the firm's shares 
Marsh has said it is co-operating fully with the SEC investigation 
Marsh is also the focus of an inquiry the New York attorney-general into whether insurers rigged the market 
Since that inquiry was launched in October Marsh has replaced its chief executive and held boardroom shake-out to meet criticism by lessening the number of company executives on the board 
Prosecutors allege that Marsh the world's biggest insurance broker and other US insurance firms may have fixed bids for corporate cover 
This is the issue at the heart of the inquiry by New York's top law officer Eliot Spitzer and separate prosecution of five insurers by the State of California 
The SEC's investigation into so-called related party transactions includes dealings in the Trident Funds managed by MMC Capital the company's private equity firm 
Marsh's new chief executive Michael Cherkasky is trying to negotiate settlement with Mr Spitzer 
Mr Spitzer has built up reputation as fierce critic and campaigner against corporate America's misdeeds 
The uncertainty unleashed by the scandal has prompted three credit rating agencies Standard Poor's Moody's and Fitch to downgrade Marsh in recent weeks 
According to the Financial Times insurance analysts are now questioning whether Marsh will be able to maintain its strong record of earning growth as they draw up forecasts for the first quarter of next year 
Doubts also exist over how much the company may have to pay regulators and lawyers to put the scandal behind

Other things being equal the notion of entrepreneurs languishing in jail while their companies are sold off for song ought to be bad for business 
But in the looking-glass world of modern Russia the opposite might just be true new report has argued 
The study from the Centre for Economic Policy Research does not praise the rough handling of oil company Yukos 
But it argues that more rigorous tax policing has benefited all Russian firms even targets of the tax police 
An increase in tax enforcement can increase the amount of dividends and other income outside shareholders will receive even accounting for increased levels of taxation the authors say 
The paper's reasoning is complex and is based on sophisticated model of the relationship between tax regimes and corporate governance in particular the propensity of management to steal from the company 
The calculations demonstrated what many Russian analysts already knew that increasing the tax rate increases the amount that managers steal since undeclared income becomes relatively more valuable 
In the West meanwhile higher tax rates translate far more smoothly into higher government revenues 
On the other hand increasing the rigour with which taxes are collected encourages companies to become more transparent forcing them to be able to demonstrate their financial position far more accurately 
The net result the authors say is that the extra amount companies pay in tax is more than compensated for by greater efficiency and financial soundness 
After Vladimir Putin became president in he did not raise taxes but put lot of effort too much critics argue into enforcement 
Since then the Russian stock market has more than trebled in value rise the authors attribute at least in part to the newly tough approach 
The report highlights the case of Sibneft Russian oil company that came close to merging with Yukos last year 
After Mr Putin came to power the company's overall effective tax rate rose from to and Sibneft was the target of series of aggressive raids by fiscal police 
But shareholders benefited hugely Sibneft started to pay dividends in and almost bn in and closed down the network of opaque subsidiaries it had previously used for siphoning off unofficial funds 
According to the authors although variety of changes were sweeping through Russian industry at the time the increase in tax enforcement is the only likely explanation for the change of fortunes at Sibneft and many of its peers 
Does this analysis make sense 
In part certainly 
For all its faults corporate Russia has become far more orderly and law-abiding since 
Companies have rushed to list their shares on international stock exchanges something unthinkable in the wilder days of the and most large firms now produce their accounts to international standards 
Foreign direct investment long negligible is starting to flow in serious amounts bn in and stock market returns have been among the healthiest in Europe 
But the authors' model does not quite cover all the complexities 
For start the model assumes that the various parties have clearly-defined motivation companies want to maximise profit governments want to maximise tax revenue 
In fact the alarmingly close connections between big business and government in Russia connections often greased by bribery blur the apparently antagonistic relationship 
Companies can for example persuade officials to overlook non-payment of taxes 
And the authors' definition of tax enforcement seems unrealistically Western 
Genuine disinterested tax collection might well work wonders in Russia the problem with recent examples has been the erratic and unpredictable way laws are enforced 
The case against Yukos for example has moved in fits and starts with little clarity from the government about its intentions and little faith from investors that the letter of the law would be followed 
As far as most commentators are concerned the state is pursuing Yukos out of political vendetta rather than simply to enforce fiscal rectitude 
Since Yukos' founder Mikhail Khodorkovsky was arrested year ago the Russian market has dropped by an indication that few investors feel optimistic about the salutary effect on corporate performance

Your child or grandchild may want the latest toy this Christmas but how about giving them present that will help their financial future 
Gifts of the financial variety might have longer lasting impact 
It may encourage children to save or start fund which could count towards university costs for example 
The government is trying to encourage saving at an early age through its new Child Trust Fund 
The first vouchers worth or for low-income families will be distributed from January 
All children born after st September will be eligible 
Parents will need to decide which financial institution will manage this gift in time for the start of the scheme in April 
Parents and relatives will be able to top up the fund with up to year which will grow free of income and capital gains tax 
As the Child Trust Fund will not be in force in time for Christmas relatives could invest their gifts in higher rate children's deposit account and use this as feeder fund 
There are accounts designed to start children off in the savings habit and they often pay higher rate of interest 
Some of the best instant-access accounts currently available include the Ladybird account from the Saffron Walden Building Society paying for minimum balance of and the Alliance Leicester FirstSaver which pays also starting at 
Interest earned by children is subject to income tax 
However children like adults have personal income tax allowance for the current tax year 
If the account holds money gifted by friends and relatives but not parents any interest earned from the savings account may be set against the allowance 
As long as the total amount of interest falls within the allowance then no tax will be payable 
When the account is opened form available from the bank or building society should be completed 
This confirms that the account holder is non-taxpayer and allows interest to be received without the deduction of income tax 
The tax rules are different for parents who save on behalf of child 
Only of interest per parent can be tax-free 
Where interest exceeds this level the whole of the interest will be taxed on the parent 
This is to prevent parents from holding their own cash savings in their children's names and taking advantage of the tax allowances 
Where both parents and other relatives are saving on behalf of child consideration should be given to opening separate accounts one for parents' gifts and one for gifts from other relatives 
Therefore it may be preferable for parents to contribute to the Child Trust Fund which is tax free with any gifts from relatives that take the total above the annual limit being directed to deposit account 
Another favourite solution is Premium Bonds 
With the promise of riches far greater than mere deposit account they make great presents 
The parent or guardian will be responsible for the Bonds and will receive notification of the purchase 
Any prizes will be sent to the parent or child's guardian 
The minimum for each purchase is and Bonds are sold in multiples of 
There are gift opportunities beyond cash accounts and these should not be ignored 
Over the longer term stock market funds have outperformed other types of investment although in the shorter term they can be volatile 
One of the benefits of investing for children is that investment is generally for the longer term more than ten years which helps to reduce the risks associated with investing in shares 
One way to spread the risk is to invest in the stock market through unit or investment trust 
These are pooled investment funds which give access to wide range of shares 
These funds may be actively managed where fund manager picks individual stocks based on view of their future potential or passive where manager invests in all the shares that comprise stock market index for example the FTSE 
Exchange Traded Funds offer an alternative way to track stock market 
These are single shares that give the return of an underlying index so are really another form of tracker 
The difference is that the charges are quite low 
The only drawback with all financial gifts is that the children gain an absolute right to the money at age and parents will have no control over how it is spent 
For larger gifts it may be worthwhile taking professional advice on the establishment of suitable trust that will allow ongoing control over the capital and income

China's national airline is to make its overseas stock market debut with dual listing in London and Hong Kong the London Stock Exchange LSE has said 
Air China plans to raise bn from the flotation 
Share trading will begin on December the LSE said 
For China's aviation authorities the listing is part of the modernisation of its airline sector to cope with soaring demand for air travel 
No further details of the share price or number of shares were given 
The LSE has been working hard to woo Chinese companies to choose London rather than New York for their listings 
It opened an Asia-Pacific office in Hong Kong last month

The London Stock Exchange offers ambitious Chinese companies access to the world's most international equity market combined with high regulatory and corporate governance standards she said 
spokesman for the LSE said We've been engaged with them Air China for about months two years now 
As part of its pitch to bring listings to London the LSE is thought to be highlighting the extra costs and red-tape imposed by new US laws passed since the Enron scandal whilst stressing London's strong regulatory environment 
Germany's Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder began three-day visit to Beijing on Monday by signing deal worth bn euros bn for Airbus to sell new planes to Air China the Deutsche Welle radio station reported 
China's booming economy has created huge demand for air travel among middle-class Chinese turning the country into sales battleground between rival plane makers Airbus and Boeing 
Air China's long-awaited flotation is part of strategy to modernise dozen state-owned carriers which have been reorganised into three groups under Air China China Southern and China Eastern 
Merrill Lynch are sole bookrunners for Air China's flotation which will take the form of share placing with institutional investors in London though retail investors may be able to buy Air China shares in Hong Kong 
Air China's primary listing will be in Hong Kong with secondary listing in London 
The shares will be denominated in Hong Kong dollars 
However investors may be wary of Chinese stocks

Oil prices have fallen heavily for second day closing at three-month lows after news that US crude stocks have improved ahead of winter 
London Brent crude closed at on Thursday drop of having dived below barrel for the first time since mid-September 
US light crude traded in New York lost more than to its lowest close since September 
The price of both benchmark crudes has dropped in two days 
The falls were triggered when the Energy Information Administration EIA said on Wednesday that US crude stocks were higher than year ago 
The news calmed worries about winter shortages 
Weak US fuel and heating oil stocks have been persistent factor in pushing up oil prices 
It's amazing how quickly sentiment changed said Rick Mueller an analyst at Energy Security Analysis 
Analysts also attributed the fall to mild early-winter weather which has tempered demand for heating oil 
The stronger fuel inventories helped boost US stock markets to nine-month highs on Wednesday though only the Nasdaq index had hung onto those gains by the end of Thursday 
In London the FTSE index closed points higher at 
The long-awaited drop in oil prices helped to ease persistent investor jitters over the impact of energy costs on company profits and economic growth 
However traders warned that the fall could be short-lived if there is cold snap in North America this winter or any major supply problems in other parts of the world 
The price of crude is still up about on the start of but has fallen from the record of set in late October 
Opec nations have increased production to -year highs to meet global demand and this has helped rebuild US stocks hit by supply disruptions after Hurricane Ivan in September 
Traders were also encouraged by comments on Wednesday from the energy minister of Opec member Algeria 
Chakib Khelil said the cartel was likely to keep output unchanged when it meets next week 
However some analysts believe the sharp fall in crude prices may harden Opec's attitude to over-production leading to scaling back of oil output 
Fears still remain over the level of US heating oil stocks which are rising but remain down on levels 
cold spell in north America would start to deplete supplies and could spark further price rises 
Analysts however say prices will fall further if inventories continue to rise 
Mother Nature is going to be huge in the next several weeks said Kyle Cooper at Citigroup Global Markets 
Long term think we're headed to but don't think we're doing that yet 
We have lot of winter left 
John Person president of National Futures Advisory Services said the EIA data indicated there should be adequate supplies for the next three months in the US

Arsenal vice-chairman David Dein has said the club may consider seeking full listing for its shares on the London Stock Exchange 
Speaking at the Soccerex football business forum in Dubai he said full listing was one of the options for funding after the club moves to its new stadium 
The club which is currently listed on the smaller Ofex share exchange is due to move into its new -seater Emirates Stadium at Ashburton Grove for the start of the season 
Mr Dein also warned the current level of TV coverage of the Premiership may be reaching saturation level with signs that match attendances have been dropping off in the first few months of this season 
When Arsenal moves to its new stadium it will see its proportion of turnover from media earnings drop from this season to in two years' time 
The club is hoping to increase matchday earnings from to of turnover and has not ruled out other money-earning means including full share listing 
When the new stadium opens we will go through thorough financial review Mr Dein said 
Listing would be one option but we are flexible and no decisions have been made on that issue yet 
We want to be in the best financial health maybe clubs can do it listing Manchester United have been success 

Mr Dein said that although television money and coverage had driven the English game forward in the past years he feared there might now be too many games being shown 
Since the formation of the Premier League in season Premiership clubs have seen their income from television soar 
Television has been the driving force over the past years 
but we must constantly improve if we want to remain as the world's leading league competition 
We must monitor the quality of the product and ensure attendances do not decline and we must balance that with the quantity of exposure on TV too 
think we have practically reached saturation point 
sometimes think less is more 

The club is funding its move to Ashburton Grove through number of sources including debt from banks from money it already has and will receive in coming years from sponsors and from the sale of surplus property including its Highbury Stadium 
It is also looking to create new revenue streams from overseas markets including Asia 
We have two executives travelling round Japan and China at the moment building relationships with organisations and clubs and we know our supporters clubs are growing there too as they are around the world 
We have got very good product so it is very important we go and look at these markets and make sure we are on the case

Investors were deeply suspicious of President da Silva former trade union leader who campaigned on programme of extensive land redistribution and large rise in the minimum wage 
However Mr da Silva has stuck to an orthodox monetary policy inherited from his predecessor even in the face of last year's economic crisis 
This has earned him the disapproval of rural farm workers thousands of whom who took to the streets of Brasilia on Thursday to protest against government policies 
President da Silva has defended his policies arguing that Brazil cannot afford to continue the cycle of boom and bust which afflicted it in recent decades

Rising oil prices and the sinking dollar hit shares on Monday after finance ministers' meeting and stern words from Fed chief Alan Greenspan 
The London FTSE fell while Tokyo's Nikkei dropped its steepest fall in three months 
finance ministers said nothing about supporting the dollar whose slide could further jeopardise growth in Japan and Europe 
And Mr Greenspan warned Asian states could soon stop funding the US deficit 
On Monday afternoon the euro was close to an all-time high against the dollar at above 
Oil pushed higher too on Monday as investors fretted about cold weather in the US and Europe and potential output cut from oil producers' group Opec although prices had cooled by the end of the day 
In London the benchmark Brent crude price closed down cents at barrel while New York light sweet crude closed down cents at barrel 
The slide comes as the US has been attempting to talk up the traditional strong dollar policy 
The latest to pitch in has been President George Bush himself who told the Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation Apec summit in Chile that he remained committed to halving the budget deficit 
Together with bn trade gap the red ink spreading across America's public finances is widely seen as key factor driving the dollar lower 
And last week US Treasury Secretary John Snow told an audience in the UK that the policy remained unaltered 
But he also said that the rate was entirely up to the markets signal which traders took as advice to sell the dollar 
Some had looked to the meeting for direction 
But Mr Snow made clear exchange rates had not been on the agenda 
For the US government letting the dollar drift is useful short-term fix 
US exports get more affordable helping perhaps to close the trade gap 
In the meantime the debt keeps getting bigger with Congress authorising an bn rise in what the US can owe taking the total to trillion 
But in speech on Friday Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan warned that in the longer term things are likely to get tricky 
At present much of gap in both public debt is covered by selling bonds to Asian states such as Japan and China since the dollar is seen as the world's reserve currency 
Similarly Asian investment helps bridge the gap in the current account the deficit between what the US as whole spends and what it earns 
But already they are turning more cautious an auction of debt in August found few takers 
And Mr Greenspan said that could turn into trend if the fall of the dollar kept eating into the value of those investments 
It seems persuasive that given the size of the US current account deficit diminished appetite for adding to dollar balances must occur at some point he said

Germany's unemployment figure rose above the psychologically important level of five million last month 
On Wednesday the German Federal Labour Agency said the jobless total had reached million in January which takes the jobless rate to 
Yes we have effectively more than five million people unemployed government minister said earlier on ZDF public television 
Unemployment has not been this high in Germany since the 
Changes to the way the statistics are compiled partly explain the jump of in the numbers 
But the figures are embarrassing for the government 
With the figures apparently the worst we've seen in the post-war period these numbers are very charged politically said Christian Jasperneite an economist with MM Warburg 
They could well put an end to the recent renaissance we've seen by the SPD the ruling Social Democrats in the polls and with state elections due in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia they may have an adverse effect on the government's chances there 

The opposition also made political capital from the figures 
It said there are further million- million people on subsidised employment schemes who are in fact looking for real jobs

Under the government's controversial Hartz IV reforms which came into effect at the beginning of the year both those on unemployment benefits and welfare support and those who are long-term unemployed are officially classified as looking for work

Three years after gruelling economic crisis Turkey has dressed its economy to impress 
As part of charm offensive ahead of December when the European Union will decide whether to start entry talks Turkey's economic leaders have been banging the drum to draw attention to recent achievements 
The economy is growing fast they insist 
Education levels among its young and large population are rising 
Unemployment levels in percentage terms are heading fast towards single digits 
Inflation is under control 
new law to govern its turbulent banking system is on the cards 
The tourism industry is booming and revenues from visitors should more than double to bn bn in three years 
Moreover government spending is set to be frozen and burdensome social security deficit is being tackled 
Income and corporate taxes will be cut next year in order to attract bn of foreign investment over the next three years 
loan restructuring deal with the International Monetary Fund IMF is pretty much in the can 
And following recent macroeconomic restructuring efforts its currency is floating freely and its central bank is independent 
The point of all this has been to convince Europe's decision makers that rather than being phenomenally costly exercise for the EU allowing Turkey in would in fact bring masses of economic benefits 
The cake will be bigger for everybody said Deputy Prime Minister Abdullatif Sener earlier this month 
Turkey will not be burden for the EU budget 
If admitted into the EU Turkey would contribute almost bn euros bn bn to its budget by according to recent impact study by the country's State Planning Organisation 
As Turkey's gross domestic output GDP is set to grow by per year on average its contribution would rise from less than bn euros in to almost bn euros by 
Turkey could also help alleviate labour shortage in Old Europe once its population comes of age 
By one in four Turks or about million people will be aged or less 
literate and qualified Turkish population insisted Mr Sener will make positive impact on the EU 

This runs contrary to the popular view that Turkey is getting ready to dig deep into EU taxpayers' wallets 
However Turkey's assertions are confirmed by Brussels' own impact studies which indeed say that Turkish membership would be good news for the EU economy 
But only over time 
Costs are projected to be vast during the early years of Turkey's membership with subsidies alone estimated to exceed bn euros and according to some predictions balloon to bn euros 
This would include vast agricultural subsidies and regional aid though such payments should decline as the country's farm sector which currently employs one in three Turks would employ just one in five by 
Such high initial expenses would be coupled with risks that the benefits flagged up by Turkey's government would never be delivered say those who feel the Turkish project should be shunned 
Some fear that rather than providing an educated sophisticated labour force for Europe at large the people who will leave Turkey to seek work abroad will be poor uneducated and plentiful 
More recently less palatable concerns at least in liberal European circles have been voiced with senior EU or member state officials talking darkly of river of Islam an oriental culture and threat to Europe's cultural richness 
Of course many opponents are politically motivated their views ranging from xenophobic prejudices about the country's Muslim traditions to well-documented concerns about the government's human rights record 
Yet their economic arguments should not be dismissed out of hand 
Critics insist that much of the optimism about Turkey's economic roadmap has been over-egged an argument amplified by rise in the country's current account deficit to bn during the first months of this year 
The country's massive debt which includes bn owed to the IMF and billions borrowed via the international bond markets also remains major obstacle to its ambition of joining the EU 
In the new member states of the European Union gross public debt is typically about of gross domestic product says Reza Moghadam assistant director of the IMF's European Department 
At about of GDP Turkey's gross debt is double that figure 
Turkey's debts have largely arisen from its efforts to push through banking reform after run on the banks in caused the country's devastating recession 
There is no question that although Turkey is doing much better than in the past it remains quite vulnerable says Michael Deppler director of the IMF's European Department 
Its debt is far too high for an emerging economy 
key factor for EU decision makers should be whether or not Turkey has met its economic criteria 
But economics is not science 
And although the state of Turkey's economy is important as is its pace of reform the final decision on December will be taken by politicians who will of course be guided by their political instincts

Deutsche Boerse bosses have held constructive professional and friendly talks with the London Stock Exchange LSE its chief has said 
Werner Seifert met LSE chief executive Clara Furse amid rumours the German group may raise its bid to bn bn from its initial bn offer 
However rival suitor Euronext also upped the ante in the bid battle 
Ahead of talks with the LSE on Friday the pan-European bourse said it may be prepared to make its offer in cash 
The Paris-based exchange owner of Liffe in London is reported to be ready to raise bn to fund bid 
The news came as Deutsche Boerse held its third meeting with the LSE since its bid approach in December which was turned down by the London exchange for undervaluing the business 
However the LSE did agree to leave the door open for talks to find out whether significantly-improved proposal would be in the interests of LSE's shareholders and customers 
In the meantime Euronext which combines the Paris Amsterdam and Lisbon stock exchanges also began talks with the LSE 
In statement on Thursday Euronext said any offer was likely to be solely in cash but added that There can be no assurances at this stage that any offer will be made 
deal with either bidder would create the biggest stock market operator in Europe and the second biggest in the world after the New York Stock Exchange 
However neither side has made formal offer for the LSE with sources claiming such step may still be weeks away 
Deutsche Boerse could also face mounting opposition to bid at home 
Among sweeteners reported to have been discussed by Mr Seifert with Ms Furse were plans to move the management of its cash and Eurex derivatives market to London as well as two members of its executive board 
But Hans Reckers board member of Germany's central bank the Bundesbank said that cash trading should also remain in Frankfurt something Deutsche Boerse could move to the UK 
It is not just the headquarters of the Boerse but also important market segments that must stay permanently in Frankfurt 
This has special importance for the business activities of the banks and the consultants he said 
Local government officials in Frankfurt's state of Hessen have also spoken out against the move 
It is our wish that the headquarters stay here to maintain Frankfurt's standing as the number one financial centre in continental Europe Alois Rhiel its minister for economic affairs added

The China Three Gorges Project Corp is refusing to obey government order to stop construction of one of its giant dams the Chinese state press has said 
The builder of the Three Gorges Dam is continuing work on the sister Xiluodu dam said the Beijing News 
The Xiluodu dam is one of such large-scale construction projects called to halt because of lack of proper environmental checks 
The Beijing News said the company may instead choose to pay fine 
The firm has also ignored orders to stop construction at two of its other projects the Three Gorges Underground Power Plant and the Three Gorges Project Electrical Power Supply Plant 
So far only of the construction projects targeted by China's State Environmental Protection Agency Sepa for having not carried out mandatory environmental impact assessments have complied with its shutdown order 
The China Three Gorges Project Corp could now face fine up to yuan 
Last week it denied that its projects violated regulations 
The Three Gorges Corporation has all along abided by the law and have built our projects in accordance with the law it said 
The Sepa order comes as the Chinese government appears to be trying to cool the country's booming economy 
Previously it has encouraged construction of new electricity generating capacity to solve chronic energy shortages which forced many factories into part-time working last year 
In China increased its generating capacity by to megawatts MW 
The Xiluodu Dam is designed to produce MW of electricity and is being built on the Jinshajiang or river of golden sand as the upper reaches of the Yangtze are known

Slower economic growth rising oil prices stronger yen and weaker exports were blamed for the fall in confidence 
Despite this traders expect strength in the global economy to benefit Japan which has been close to sliding into recession in recent months 
Structural reform within Japan and an anticipated end to the banking sector's bad debt problems should also help they say

Beyond the desperate security situation in Iraq lies an economy in tatters 
vicious cycle of unemployment poor social services and poverty has been made worse by lack of investment 
So there is much hope that an elected government will break the deadlock 
First rule of law then the economy says Radwan Hadi deputy managing director of Aberdeen-based oil and gas consultancy Blackwatch Petroleum Services which entered Iraq in 
Mr Hadi's view about what the new government's priorities should be is shared by many Iraqis 
The economy has become the second-most dominant issue for many political parties ahead of Sunday's election according to Bristol University political scientist Anne Alexander who is working on project that looks at governance and security in post-war Iraq 
Job creation ranks high both on election manifestos and on the Iraqi people's wish list 
Nobody knows exactly how many Iraqis are out of work but it is clear that the situation is dire 
Estimates of Iraq's unemployment rate vary but we estimate it to be between the Washington-based independent think-tank The Brookings Institution says in its Iraq Index 
But some progress has been made largely thanks to the country's oil revenues which have exceeded bn since June 
Iraq's infrastructure is on the mend with notable improvements having been made in areas such as electricity supply irrigation telephone networks and the re-opening of hospitals 
But serious problems remain and the growing divide between haves and have-nots is angering voters 
One Iraqi woman told Ms Alexander about her frustration as she watched TV adverts for private hospitals soon after having failed to track down basic medicines from Baghdad's pharmacies 
Observes Mr Hadi The economy at present marks big divide the rich get richer the poor get poorer 
An indication of this can be seen in the world of finance where in contrast with the daily plight of ordinary people private banks operate only one of which is run in accordance with Islamic banking principles 
Hopes are high for the future of finance so foreign banks have been buying into the sector 
National Bank of Kuwait has bought majority stake in Credit Bank of Iraq the Jordanian investment bank Export Finance Bank has bought of National Bank of Iraq 
Foreign firms also hope to cash in on the reconstruction effort 
Bechtel's efforts to rebuild schools and restore power have attracted controversy as well as boosting its bottom line while Halliburton has enjoyed wealth of military contracts 
But the involvement of foreign firms in the health and banking sectors and beyond sits uneasily with many Iraqis who are accustomed to the state taking responsibility for functions that are essential to making society work observes Ms Alexander 
It is seen as selling off of Iraq's assets and bringing in multinationals at the expense of Iraqi businesses and Iraqi workers she says 
Consequently the transitional government has been forced to backtrack in recent months over its proposal to allow foreign ownership of Iraqi assets she explains 
In the West it is easy to forget that the otherwise brutal Baathist regime used to look after the majority of Iraq's citizens rather well in terms of job creation social security and healthcare 
Opinion polls suggest that people still want the state to take leading role in providing these things Ms Alexander says 
Yet in some areas of the economy investment from abroad is still warmly welcomed insists Mr Hadi an Iraqi who left the country three decades ago 
think the private sector will evolve incredibly fast Mr Hadi says 
Iraq's vast natural resources can support any magnitude of economic growth 

Many foreign companies say they are keen to get in on the act yet few are actually entering the country in any meaningful way 
But there are exceptions 
Mr Hadi's Blackwatch is just one of many small operators preparing for much bigger future 
Blackwatch's Baghdad-based affiliate Falcon Group has dozens of people working for it across the country in Kirkuk and Baghdad and its engineers and geo-scientists work with the Iraqi oil ministry to hammer out technology transfer issues Mr Hadi points out 
These guys are trying to work 
The Iraqi business people will do business at all times 
Life goes on in Iraq the people take responsibility they want to live normal lives

Most EU countries have failed to put in place policies aimed at making Europe the world's most competitive economy by the end of the decade report says 
The study undertaken by the European Commission sought to assess how far the EU has moved towards meeting its economic targets 
In EU leaders at summit in Lisbon pledged the European economy would outstrip that of the US by 
Their economic targets became known as the Lisbon Agenda 
But the Commission report says that in most EU countries the pace of economic reform has been too slow and fulfilling the Lisbon ambitions will be difficult if not impossible 
Only the UK Finland Belgium Denmark Ireland and the Netherlands have actually followed up policy recommendations 
Among the biggest laggards according to the report are Greece and Italy 
The Lisbon Agenda set out to increase the number of people employed in Europe by encouraging more older people and women to stay in the workforce 
It also set out to raise the amount the private sector spends on research and development while bringing about greater discipline over public spending and debt levels 
Combined with high environmental standards and efforts to level the playing field for businesses throughout the EU the plan was for Europe to become the world's most dynamic economy by 
Next week the Commission will present revised proposals to meet the Lisbon goals 
Many people expect the target to be quietly dropped

China's economy has expanded by breakneck during faster than predicted and well above 's 
The news may mean more limits on investment and lending as Beijing tries to take the economy off the boil 
China has sucked in raw materials and energy to feed its expansion which could have knock-on effects on the rest of the world if it overheats 
But officials pointed out that industrial growth had slowed with services providing much of the impetus 
Growth in industrial output the main target of government efforts to impose curbs on credit and investments was in down from the previous year 
Still consumer prices at rose faster than in adding to concern that sharp rise in producer prices of could stoke inflation 
And overall investment in fixed assets was still high up from the previous year although some way off the peak of seen in the first quarter of 
The result could be higher interest rates 
China raised rates by percentage points to its first hike in nine years in October 
Despite the apparent rebalancing of the economy the overall growth picture remains strong economists said 
There is no sign of slowdown in said Tim Congdon economist at ING Barings 
China's economy is not only gathering speed thanks to domestic demand but also from soaring sales overseas 
Figures released earlier this year showed exports at six-year high in up 
Part of the impetus comes from the relative cheapness of the yuan China's currency 
The government keeps it pegged close to rate of to the US dollar much to the chagrin of many US lawmakers who blame China for lost jobs and competitiveness 
Despite urging to ease the peg officials insist they are long way from ready to make shift to more market-set rate

In his twenties he battled tuberculosis for eight years then went on to run his own clothing business before marrying in his late thirties 
And the -year-old Torao Toshitsune has eaten raw fish pretty much every day throughout his life 
Mr Toshitsune is one of Japan's centenarians club that is growing by annually and where the oldest member is 
At his neat Osaka detached house where he lives with one of his sexagenarian daughters Mr Toshitsune keeps regular routine of copying out Buddhist sutras and preparing the traditional Japanese tea ceremony 
Between tasks this remarkably active senior citizen reveals what his next goal is Well what's most important for me is to be Japan's number one 
Mr Toshitsune wants to outlive everyone 
And when it comes to longevity Japan as country appears to be doing just that 
Women can expect to live until men until four years longer than Americans and Europeans 
On the outskirts of Kyoto -year-old Yuji Shimizu contemplates this phenomenon during round of golf with his younger friends who are in their seventies 
think this is because the food industry and the environment have improved he remarks 
On average we can live longer 
Whether it's the diet or the traditional family structure where roles were clearly defined or just something in the genes Japan's elderly are remarkable 
But while life may be game of golf for Mr Shimizu his grandchildren have huge problems ahead 
Japan is the world's least fertile nation with childbirth rates of just two thirds of that in the US 
By Japan's population is expected to peak at million then shrink to under million by the middle of the century 
This means million fewer workers at time when the number of elderly will have almost doubled 
In the year if the birth rate remains the same people over will make up over of the population explains Shigeo Morioka of the International Longevity Centre in Tokyo 
So how will Japan's finances stay on track 
After decade of economic stagnation and huge deficit spending the public sector debt is already about of the country's gross domestic product GDP the highest rate among industrialised countries 
The International Monetary Fund predicts that as the falling birth rate takes grip from the cost of running Japan's welfare state will double to more than of GDP while current account balances will deteriorate by over 
But unfortunately Japan appears poorly prepared both financially and politically 
Glen Wood Vice President of Deutsche Securities Japan asks Who's going to fund the pension fund for the next generation and indeed who are going to be the new Japanese worker 
Who is going to build the economy who are going to be the leaders 
Who are going to be the producers of the GDP going forward 
One option is further welfare reform 
Another is immigration possibly from the Philippines and Indonesia 
But so far any emerging policy appears restricted to limited number of nursing staff 
Standing next to Tokyo harbour is version of New York's Statue of Liberty 
But as yet Japan is not ready for an Ellis Island 
Japan has never really liked that option in its history and think it's an option that's becoming more and more plausible and necessary insists Mr Wood 
In Japan as in Europe which also faces workforce decline immigration is very sensitive subject 
But for the Japanese economy facing fewer consumers by means slumping domestic sales of cars hi-tech kit and home appliances perhaps even another property crash 
Of course the Japanese could always have more children 
The government is currently considering financial rewards for procreative couples similar to those in operation in Australia 
But there would be no pay back until when today's babies are taxpayers and the demographic crisis like in Europe starts to unfold in 
In contrast to Japan and of course the European Union the US population is expected to increase by to million by the middle of the century 
Although President Bush must re-devise Social Security to take account of rise in America's over the IMF foresees positive contribution to the US current account balance from the combined forces of fertility and immigration 
Some voices in Japanese industry are calling for radical changes to the nature of the Japanese labour market 
They want shift towards financial services though doubts persist over the country's ability let alone willingness to move away from manufacturing 
Japan still has problems getting viable banking system let alone shifting their auto business or their semi-conductor business or the broad based tech manufacturing business overseas says Mr Wood 
Japan can either drive some radical reforms or else run the risk of vicious ageing recession 
Falling demand and lower tax take could result in soaring budget pressures and basket case currency 
Come Japan could be more dependent on shrinking workforce than any other industrialised power 
There are fears that the world's number two economy is doomed to permanent recession 
But none of this is Mr Toshitsune's concern anymore 
At he chuckles that he feels fine

The UK manufacturing sector will continue to face serious challenges over the next two years the British Chamber of Commerce BCC has said 
The group's quarterly survey of companies found exports had picked up in the last three months of to their best levels in eight years 
The rise came despite exchange rates being cited as major concern 
However the BCC found the whole UK economy still faced major risks and warned that growth is set to slow 
It recently forecast economic growth will slow from more than in to little below in both and 
Manufacturers' domestic sales growth fell back slightly in the quarter the survey of firms found 
Employment in manufacturing also fell and job expectations were at their lowest level for year 
Despite some positive news for the export sector there are worrying signs for manufacturing the BCC said 
These results reinforce our concern over the sector's persistent inability to sustain recovery 
The outlook for the service sector was uncertain despite an increase in exports and orders over the quarter the BCC noted 
The BCC found confidence increased in the quarter across both the manufacturing and service sectors although overall it failed to reach the levels at the start of 
The reduced threat of interest rate increases had contributed to improved confidence it said 
The Bank of England raised interest rates five times between November and August last year 
But rates have been kept on hold since then amid signs of falling consumer confidence and slowdown in output 
The pressure on costs and margins the relentless increase in regulations and the threat of higher taxes remain serious problems BCC director general David Frost said 
While consumer spending is set to decelerate significantly over the next months it is unlikely that investment and exports will rise sufficiently strongly to pick up the slack

The Bank of England has left interest rates on hold again at in widely-predicted move 
Rates went up five times from November as the bank sought to cool the housing market and consumer debt but have remained unchanged since August 
Recent data has indicated slowdown in manufacturing and consumer spending as well as in mortgage approvals 
And retail sales disappointed over Christmas with analysts putting the drop down to less consumer confidence 
Rising interest rates and the accompanying slowdown in the housing market have knocked consumers' optimism causing sharp fall in demand for expensive goods according to report earlier this week from the British Retail Consortium 
The BRC said Britain's retailers had endured their worst Christmas in decade 
Today's no change decision is correct said David Frost Director General of the British Chambers of Commerce BCC 
But if there are clear signs that the economy slows the MPC should be ready to take quick corrective action and cut rates 
Dismal reports from the retail trade about Christmas sales are worrying if they indicate more general weakening in consumer spending 

Mr Frost added The housing market outlook remains highly uncertain 
It is widely accepted that if house prices start falling more sharply the risks facing the economy will worsen considerably 
CBI chief economist Ian McCafferty said the economy had slowed in recent months in response to rate rises but that it was difficult to gauge from the Christmas period the likely pace of activity through the summer 
The Bank is having to juggle the emergence of inflationary pressures driven by tight labour market and buoyant commodity prices against the risk of an over-abrupt slowdown in consumer activity he said 
Interest rates are likely to remain on hold for some time 

On Thursday there was more gloomy news on the manufacturing front as the Office for National ONS statistics revealed British manufacturing output unexpectedly fell in November for the fifth month in the past six 
The ONS said manufacturing output dropped in November matching similar unrevised fall in October and confounding economists' expectations of rise 
Manufacturers' organisation the EEF said it expected the hold in interest rates to continue in the near future 
It also said there was evidence that manufacturers' confidence may be waning as the outlook for the world economy becomes more uncertain 
So far the evidence suggests that last year's rate increases have helped to rebalance the economy without damaging the recovery in manufacturing said EEF chief economist Steve Radley 
However should the business outlook start to deteriorate the Bank should stand ready to cut rates 
Some economists have predicted rates will drop later in the year although others feel the Bank may still think there is need for rise to before that happens 
The Bank remains concerned about the long-term risks posed by personal debt which is rising at year if economic conditions worsen

US tobacco companies have welcomed an appeal court's decision to reject the government's bn bn claim for alleged deceit about smoking dangers 
Tobacco stocks rose sharply on Wall Street after the decision 
The court in Washington found the case filed by the Clinton administration in could not be brought under federal anti-racketeering laws 
Anti-smoking groups urge the government to fight on but the Justice Department has not said if it will appeal 
Among the accused were Altria Group RJ Reynolds Tobacco Lorillard Tobacco Liggett Group and Brown and Williamson 
They were delighted by the decision which sent Reynolds shares up and Altria shares up 
Charles Blixt executive vice-president of RJ Reynolds Tobacco said the ruling dramatically transforms the government's lawsuit 
Altria Group said in statement the government now must not only prove that the companies have engaged in fraudulent behaviour in the past but that they are likely to do so in the future 

The government had claimed tobacco firms 
manipulated nicotine levels to increase addiction 
targeted teenagers with multi-billion dollar advertising campaigns 
lied about the dangers of smoking and ignored research to the contrary 


Prosecutors wanted the cigarette firms to disgorge bn in profits accumulated over the past years and impose tougher rules on marketing their products 
They brought the case under racketeering laws which were passed to deny mafia gangs the profits of their crimes 
But the tobacco companies denied that they illegally conspired to promote smoking and defraud the public 
They also said they had already met many of the government's demands in landmark bn settlement reached with states in 
The three-judge panel in the District of Columbia's Court of Appeals ruled on Friday that the US government could not sue the firms under the anti-racketeering laws 
Judge David Sentelle in his ruling said such laws were aimed at putting an end to illegal conduct going forward 
We hold that the language of the law and the comprehensive remedial scheme of the law preclude disgorgement as possible remedy in this case he wrote 
The Justice Department refused to say if it would appeal 
All we're saying today is that we have received the ruling and are reviewing it spokeswoman said on Friday 
But William Corr of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids urged the government to continue pressing its case 
Today's ruling should not be an excuse for this administration to seek weak settlement that lets the tobacco industry off the hook he said

According to Labor Department figures new jobs were added last month 
That took 's total to million the best showing in five years 
Job creation was one of last year's main concerns for the US economy 
While worries still remain the conditions are set for steady growth in analysts said 
The unemployment rate stayed at in December and about jobs will need to be created each month if that figure is to drop 
It was respectable report said Michael Moran analyst at Daiwa Securities 
Payroll growth in December was little lighter than the consensus forecast but we had upward revisions to the prior two months and an increase in manufacturing employment 
Manufacturing is cyclical area of the economy and if it's showing job growth it's good indication that the economy is on solid growth track 
That means that the Federal Reserve is likely to continue its policy of raising interest rates 
The Fed lifted borrowing costs five times last year to citing evidence the US economic recovery was becoming more robust 
Job creation was one of last year's main concerns for the US economy and proved to be main topic of debate in the US presidential election

Overall compared to the previous year it looks great it just keeps going stronger and stronger and expect that to be the case in said Kurt Karl economist at Swiss Re in New York 
Meanwhile economists cautioned against reading too much into data from the Federal Reserve showing an unexpected bn drop in consumer debt in November 
fall in consumer spending which makes up about two-thirds of all US economic activity could help limit the extent of any future interest rate rises 
But economists said there could be number of reasons for fall in the borrowing which include credit cards and personal loans while noting that such figures can vary on month-to-month basis

Malcolm Glazer has made fresh approach to buy Manchester United which could lead to bid valuing the Premiership club at 
The US tycoon who has been wooing the club for the last months has approached the United board with detailed proposals it has confirmed 
Mr Glazer who owns the Tampa Bay Buccaneers team hopes this will lead to formal bid being accepted 
His new offer is expected to contain substantially less debt 
Mr Glazer has already had one takeover attempt turned down by the Red Devils and responded by using his shareholding to vote off three board members last November 
Man United had turned down the bid because it was based on high level of borrowing 
But newspapers have speculated recently that the tycoon had gained the support of leading banks to come up with stronger and less debt-laden bid 
Last week however Mr Glazer issued statement to the Stock Exchange distancing himself from new bid 
Meanwhile United's chief executive David Gill said in December that talks would not resume unless Glazer came up with definitive proposals 
Now the board has confirmed that the US bidder is back with statement issued on Sunday reading The board can confirm it has now received detailed proposal subject to various preconditions which may form the basis of an offer 
further announcement will be made in due course 

To succeed Malcolm Glazer will still need the approval of major shareholders John Magnier and JP McManus who own of the club 
But the Irish duo have cut off talks with Glazer over the proposed sale of their stake and have so far made no comment on his latest approach 
United fans have reacted with anger at the announcement 
They have vehemently opposed any proposed takeover by Glazer since he first showed interest in the club in September and after Sunday's announcement they vowed to fight on 
We will fight tooth and nail to stop him whatever his offer says 
We do not want him or anybody else taking over United said Mark Longden of the Independent Manchester United Supporters' Association 
The campaign against this proposed takeover will continue as it has done since Glazer first showed interest in the club

The benchmark Dow Jones share index closed more than higher at while the Nasdaq rose to 
Many investors believe that Mr Bush's policies are more business-friendly than those of his Democrat challenger John Kerry 
The higher share prices also reflect relief that clear winner has emerged from what proved to be tight poll 
Investors had worried that the outcome of the poll would be inconclusive paving the way for repeat of the legal wrangling that marred the election 
The Dow lost of its value in the three weeks immediately after that election when it was unclear who would occupy the White House 
Mr Kerry conceded defeat on Wednesday abandoning last-ditch hopes of carrying the vote in the swing state of Ohio 
The relief for the markets may be that we have decision and can move forward said Tim Ghriskey chief investment officer of Solaris Asset Management 
Some analysts predicted that the jump in share prices would be short-lived saying investors would quickly focus once again on the health of the US economy 
would look at the stock market rally for Bush as kind of one-day event said Ken Mayland at Clearview Economics 
The US' recent economic performance has been mixed with solid growth offset by disappointingly low job creation figures and mounting worries over record budget deficit 
Elsewhere in the financial markets on Wednesday the dollar dipped slightly against the euro and climbed against the yen while US oil prices closed up at barrel in New York 
The rise in oil prices partly reflects the view that President Bush is less likely than Mr Kerry to release supplies from the US' strategic oil reserve 
Share prices in London Frankfurt and Paris also closed higher 
Successive polls in the run-up to Tuesday's election had shown the two candidates running neck and neck 
Economic issues as well as the war in Iraq were the forefront of the campaign 
In key swing states such as Ohio which has suffered substantial job losses in the past four years President Bush's handling of the economy became crucial election issue 
Senator Kerry attacked President Bush's economic record during his campaign hammering home the fact that net jobs were lost during his term in office 
President Bush focused on the fact that two million jobs have been created in the past year claiming that it has vindicated his tax-cutting agenda 
As for future policies both candidates pledged to bring America's bn federal budget deficit under control 
Senator Kerry planned to increase taxes on those earning more than year 
President Bush has placed reform of the pensions system at the heart of his economic agenda for second term

Big manufacturers were even more pessimistic about the first quarter of their views suggest the March reading could go as low as still in positive territory but weaker 
The dollar's decline has strengthened the yen making Japanese exports more expensive in the US 
China's attempts to cool down its fast-growing economy have also hit Japanese industry's sales abroad

Millions of the world's poorest textile trade workers will lose their jobs under new trade rules to be introduced in the new year charity has warned 
The World Trade Organisation WTO is to end its Multi-Fibre Agreement MFA on midnight of December 
Christian Aid condemned the move saying it would see almost million jobs in Bangladesh alone being axed 
However supporters of the change claim it will mean increased efficiency and lower costs for Western consumers 
It will also see more jobs created in India and China advocates argue 
The WTO said that many developing countries support the end of quotas and stressed that funding was available to countries such as Bangladesh to help them make the transition to fully liberalised market 
There will be period of adjustment required said WTO spokesman Keith Rockwell 
Some countries will do better than others but there is no one who is suggesting that no developing country will do well out of this 
Some countries where it may appear that orders will dry up have seen orders surging and there are many companies who will continue with existing trading relationships 

Christian Aid has called on British firms not to simply cut and run but look after their workers in new report called Rags To Riches To Rags 
It added that with few employment alternatives available many sacked garment workers could end up in far worse jobs with some of the mainly female workers forced into the sex trade 
The WTO itself has warned that as many as million jobs could be lost as result of liberalisation in the textile industry 
Some of the world's fastest developing countries which rely on textile exports to build growth for example in Bangladesh textiles account for almost of the country's exports and the industry employs around million people 
The MFA pact has helped developing countries get bigger share of the world market 
The losers in this new trade landscape will be some of the most vulnerable workers in countries such as Bangladesh Cambodia Sri Lanka and Nepal Andrew Pendleton Christian Aid's head of Trade Policy said 
They will be hard-pressed to cope when garment industries there lose their protection 
We are deeply concerned that the New Year will spell misery for huge numbers of garment workers 
The WTO said there was no consenus among its members to retain the quotas and emphasised that funding was available to countries such as Bangladesh to help them adjust to the liberalised market 
It added that the impact of the changes for workers most affected by the shake-up had not been considered adding such seismic changes to policy should put the interests of poor people first rather than simply aiming to liberalise markets at any cost 
While the current MFA was not perfect its did allow Third World countries like Bangladesh to get onto the first rung of industrial development Christian Aid said 
International trade must not be governed by 'race to the bottom' that pitches one set of poor people against another Mr Pendleton added

US mortgage company Fannie Mae should restate its earnings move that is likely to put billion-dollar dent in its accounts watchdogs have said 
The Securities Exchange Commission accused Fannie Mae of using techniques that did not comply in material respects with accounting standards 
Fannie Mae last month warned that some records were incorrect 
The other main US mortgage firm Freddie Mac restated earnings by bn bn last year after probe of its books 
The SEC's comments are likely to increase pressure on Congress to strengthen supervision of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac 
The two firms are key parts of the US financial system and effectively underwrite the mortgage market financing nearly half of all American house purchases and dealing actively in bonds and other financial instruments 
The investigation of Freddie Mac in June sparked concerns about the wider health of the industry and raised questionsmarks over the role of the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight OFHEO the industry's main regulator 
Having been pricked into action the OFHEO turned its attention to Fannie May and in September this year said that the firm had tweaked its books to spread earnings more smoothly across quarters and play down the amount of risk it had taken on 
The SEC found similar problems 
The watchdog's chief accountant Donald Nicolaisen said that Fannie Mae's methodology of assessing measuring and documenting hedge ineffectiveness was inadequate and was not supported by generally accepted accounting principles

Yukos has said US bankruptcy court will decide whether to block Russia's impending auction of its main production arm on Thursday 
The Russian oil firm has filed for bankruptcy protection in the US in an attempt to halt the forced sale 
However Judge Letitia Clark said the hearing would continue on Thursday when arguments in the case would be heard 
Russian authorities are due to auction off Yuganskneftegas on December to pay huge tax bill sent to Yukos 
Russian prosecutors are forcing the sale of the firm's most lucrative asset Yuganskneftegas to help pay bn bn back tax bill which they claim is owed by Yukos 
Filing for bankruptcy protection in the US was last resort to preserve the rights of our shareholders employees and customers said Yukos chief executive Steven Theede 
The company added it had opted to take action through American courts as US bankruptcy law gives worldwide jurisdiction over debtor company's property and because it was seeking judiciary willing to protect the value of shareholders' investments 
However as the firm is based in Russia and has no significant US assets lawyers are unsure of the outcome of the case 
We are here to stop of our body from being cut off on Sunday Zack Clement lawyer for Yukos told Judge Clark in an emergency hearing in Houston Texas on Wednesday 
As well as the bid to get Chapter bankruptcy which protects firms from creditors allowing them to continue trading as they restructure their finances the group also made claim for damages against the Russian government 
Yukos asked the Houston court to order Russia to arbitration so that it can press claims for billions of dollars in damages over campaign of illegal discriminatory and disproportionate tax claims 
Mr Clement said that under Russian law the Russian government was obliged to enter into arbitration as set out in international law 
He added that the opening bid for the firm's Yuganskneftgas unit was bn less than half of the bn that Yukos advisers say it is worth 
We believe the only significant bidder at the auction on Sunday is Gazprom he said referring to Russia's natural gas giant 
Yukos maintains that the forced auction is illegal and will cause the company to suffer immediate and irreparable harm 
Many commentators believe the Russian government's aggressive pursuit of Yukos is politically-motivated response to the political ambitions of its former chief executive Mikhail Khodorkovsky 
Mr Khodorkovsky who had funded liberal opposition groups was arrested in October last year on fraud and tax evasion charges and is still in jail Analysts believe that if its production unit is auctioned off it is likely to be bought up by government-backed firm like Gazprom effectively bringing large chunk of Russia's lucrative oil and gas industry back under state control

Meanwhile demand for defibrillators which give the heart small electric shock when an irregular heartbeat or rhythm is detected is expected to increase analysts said 
The move by Johnson Johnson has been widely expected and the firm will pay for each Guidant share more than Wednesday's closing price

The Brazilian government has played down claims that it could step in to save the country's biggest airline 
Brazil's airport authority chief Carlos Wilson had claimed the government was on the brink of stepping in to save Varig Brazil's flagship airline

Varig is struggling under huge debt burden of an estimated debt of billion reais bn or bn 
Asked whether rescue was on the cards following meeting of the country's Congress to discuss the airline's crisis Mr Alencar replied No don't think so 
We will see 

Earlier Mr Wilson had said that president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has decided to step in and decree of some kind of intervention could be signed this week 
In practice it will be an intervention although this is not the technical name used he said 
An intervention means that the government would take administrative control of the company and its finances 
For that to happen Varig's main shareholder the non-profit Ruben Berta Foundation which represents the airline's employees would have to be removed Mr Wilson said 
However no jobs would be lost and the airline would keep on flying he added 
Varig which operates in countries apart from Brazil has been driven to the brink of collapse because of the country's economic downturn 
The depreciation of Brazil's currency has had direct impact on the airline's dollar debt as well as some of its costs 
Business has improved recently with demand for air travel increasing and recovery in the Brazilian economy

major reform of Brazil's bankruptcy laws has been approved by the country's Congress in move which it is hoped will cut the cost of borrowing 
The bill proposed in has finally been approved by the leadership of President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva 
The old law dating from gave priority first to workers second to tax revenue and finally to creditors 
The new legislation changes this giving priority to creditors and limiting payments to workers 
The new regulations will limit payments to workers to times the minimum monthly salary which is currently 
The law also makes it more difficult for company to declare bankruptcy 
However when firm is declared bankrupt it will gain protection from creditors for days while recovery plan is worked out 
The proposals were opposed in the past by leftist parties including Mr Lula's Worker Party 
They considered that they undermined workers' rights 
But President Lula became defender of the reforms arguing that the country's bank lending margins were among the highest in the world and were damaging the economy 
According to Andreas Adriano of Latin Trade Magazine the new bankruptcy law will help in reducing the spread difference between the interest rates of the banks and federal bonds 
Nevertheless Mr Adriano said to reduce the basic interest rate the Central Bank needs to change its policy focusing not only on inflation but also on economic growth

UK retail sales were better than expected in November as Christmas shoppers began their seasonal flock to the High Street figures show 
The Office for National Statistics ONS said retail sales rose on the month and on the year 
But the figures along with this week's inflation report could trigger another interest rate rise in the New Year 
However recent data from the British Retail Consortium showed slip in High Street sales during November 
The ONS data confounded analyst expectations 
Many had expected sales to fall slightly in November as shoppers put off buying Christmas presents until December 
However retailers' attempts to draw in the crowds may be behind November's unexpected rise in sales they say 
Aggressive tactics such as one-day discount sales adopted by stores such as Marks Spencer appear to have paid off 
Price discounting has certainly accounted for much of this because the value of retail sales hasn't grown as much as volumes said Investec economist David Page 
The figures sparked rally for sterling as the data supported the view that it is too early to assume that base rates have peaked

Shares in Cairn Energy UK oil firm have closed down after disappointing drilling update and warning over possible tax demands 
The company said tests had shown no significant finds in one of its Indian oil fields but was upbeat about the potential of other areas 
It also said the Indian government had told it to pay production tax for which Cairn argues it is not liable 
Cairn's shares have jumped by almost this year 
Investors had piled into Cairn after the company announced significant oil finds in India this year 
Chief executive Bill Gammell said on Friday he was disappointed with exploration in the so-called N-C extension area in Rajasthan 
Investors had held high hopes of major oil finds in this area 
But Cairn said estimates had been revised in what was significant downgrade of the initial expectation 
Cairn also said that the government believed the company was liable to pay taxes under its production-sharing contract 
The company said the rate would be about rupees per tonne or seven barrels of oil 
spokesman for the firm said that the tax would wipe of the field's current value 
Cairn refutes the government's position Mr Gammell said 
He insisted that the contract made it clear that the tax should be shouldered by the licensee India's state-run Oil Natural Gas Corp ONGC and not the contractor 
We have pretty strong legal case here he added saying it would only become an issue once the firm started production 
Investors took dim view of the statements though 
The shares closed down or at pence 
think people were slightly over-ambitious for how quickly Cairn would be able to develop and potentially offload these reserves said analyst Jason Kenney at ING

Baikal paid bn roubles bn bn for Yugansk nowhere near the bn Russia says Yukos owes in taxes 
Yukos reacted immediately by repeating its view that the auction was illegal in international and Russian law and said Baikal had bought itself trouble 
The company considers that the victor of today's auction has bought itself serious bn headache said Yukos spokesman Alexander Shadrin 
He said the company would continue to make every lawful move to protect tens of thousands of shareholders in Yukos from this forcible and illegitimate removal of their property 
Meanwhile Tim Osborne head of Yukos main shareholders' group Menatep said that Yukos may have to declare itself bankrupt and that legal action would be taken outside Russia against the auction winners 
Reports from Russia say Baikal has paid deposit of nearly bn from Sberbank Savings Bank account to the Russian Federal Property Fund for Yugansk 
The sale came despite restraining order issued by US court dealing with the firm's bankruptcy application for Chapter protection 
Yukos has always insisted the auction was state-sponsored theft but Russian authorities argued they were imposing the law trying to recover billions in unpaid taxes 
There were originally four registered bidders and with its close ties to the Kremlin state-backed gas monopoly Gazprom had been seen as favourite 
But just two companies turned up for the auction Gazprom and the unknown Baikal Finance Group named after large freshwater lake in Siberia 
And according to Tass news agency Gazprom did not make single bid leaving the way open for Baikal which paid above the auction start price of bn roubles 
Mystery firm Baikal Finance Group is officially registered in the central Russian region of Tver but many analysts believe it may be linked to Gazprom 
Kaha Kiknavelidze analyst at Troika Dialog said think decision that Yugansk should end up with Gazprom was taken long time ago 
So the main question was how to structure this transaction 
would not exclude that the structure of the deal has slightly changed and Gazprom now has partner 
would also not exclude that Baikal will decline to pay in days that are given by law and Gazprom is then recognised as the winner 
This would give Gazprom an extra days to accumulate the needed funds 
Another surprise was that the winner paid significant premium above the starting price 
However Gazprom has announced it is not linked to Baikal in any way 
And Paul Collison chief analyst at Brunswick UBS said see no plausible explanation for the theory that Baikal was representing competing interests 
Yugansk will most likely end up with Gazprom but could still end up with the government 
There is still potential for surprises 
Yugansk is at the heart of Yukos pumping close to million barrels of oil day 
The unit was seized by the government which claims the oil giant owes more than bn in taxes and fines 
Yukos says those tax demands are exorbitant and had sought refuge in US courts 
The US bankruptcy court's initial order on Thursday to temporarily block the sale in response to Yukos filing for Chapter bankruptcy protection was upheld in second ruling on Saturday 
The protection if recognised by the Russian authorities would have allowed Yukos' current management to retain control of the business and block the sale of any company assets 
Yukos has said the sale amounts to expropriation punishment for the political ambitions of its founder Mikhail Khodorkovsky 
Mr Khodorkovsky is now in jail on separate fraud charges 
But President Vladimir Putin has described the affair as crackdown on corruption and the BBC's Sarah Rainsford in Moscow says most Russians believe the destruction of Yukos is now inevitable 
Hours before the auction lawyers for Menatep group through which Mr Khodorkovsky and his associates control Yukos said they would take legal action in other countries 
Menatep lawyers who were excluded from observing the auction said they would retaliate by seeking injunctions in foreign courts to impound Russian oil and gas exports

Pan-European group Euronext is poised to launch bid for the London Stock Exchange UK media reports say 
Last week the LSE rejected takeover proposal from German rival Deutsche Boerse the pence-a-share offer valued the exchange at about bn 
The LSE which saw its shares rise said the bid undervalued the business 
Euronext formed after the Brussels Paris and Amsterdam exchanges merged is reportedly working with three investment banks on possible offer 
The LSE Europe's biggest stock market is key prize listing stocks with total capitalisation of trillion 
Euronext already has presence in London due to its acquisition of London-based options and futures exchange Liffe 
Trades on the LSE are cleared via Clearnet in which Euronext has quarter stake 
Euronext which also operates an exchange in Lisbon last week appointed UBS and ABN Amro as additional advisors 
It is also working with Morgan Stanley 
Despite the rejection of the Deutsche Boerse bid last week Werner Seifert chief executive of the Frankfurt-based exchange may well come back with an improved offer 
It has long wanted to link up with London and the two tried and failed to seal merger in 
Responding to the LSE's rebuff Deutsche Boerse whose market capitalisation is more than bn said it believed it could show its proposal offered benefits and that it still hoped to make cash bid 
Last week the LSE said not only was the bid undervalued but that it had been advised that there can be no assurance that any transaction could be successfully implemented 
However it has indicated it is open for further talks 
Meanwhile German magazine Der Spiegel said part of Mr Seifert's negotiations with the LSE were about where to base the future board of any merged exchange 
While Mr Seifert has suggested merged company would be run out of London the mayor of Frankfurt has raised concerns that such move could cost German jobs 
Many analysts believe German Boerse has more financial firepower than Euronext if it came to bidding war

The fate of Russia's Yuganskneftegas the oil firm sold to little-known buyer on Sunday is the subject of frantic speculation in Moscow 
Baikal Finance Group emerged as the auction winner agreeing to pay bn roubles bn bn 
Russia's newspapers claimed that Baikal was front for gas monopoly Gazprom which had been expected to win 
The sale has destroyed Yukos once the owner of Yuganskneftegas said founder Mikhail Khodorkovsky 
Yuganskneftegas has been sold in the best traditions of the 
The authorities have made themselves wonderful Christmas present Russia's most efficient oil company has been destroyed the Interfax news agency quoted Mr Khodorkovsky as saying via his lawyers 
Gazprom had been expected to win the auction but is thought to have failed to get finance for the deal after US court injunction barred it from taking part 
Last week Yukos filed for Chapter bankruptcy protection in the US in last-ditch attempt to hang on to Yuganskneftegas which accounts for of its output 
US judge banned Gazprom from taking part in the auction and barred international banks from providing the firm with cash 
They screwed up the financing said Ronald Smith an analyst at Renaissance Capital in Moscow 
And Gazprom doesn't have this sort of money lying around 

Gazprom has denied that it is behind the purchase 
It is front for somebody but not necessarily for Gazprom said Oleg Maximov an analyst at Troika Dialog in Moscow 
We don't know if this company is linked to Gazprom 
We tried to find it but we couldn't and as far as know the papers had the same result 
The sale has however bought time for Gazprom to raise the money needed for the purchase analysts said 
One scenario is that Baikal will not pay when it is supposed to in two weeks time putting Yuganskneftegas back in the hands of bailiffs and back within the reach of Gazprom 
Yukos is not planning on letting go of its unit without fight and has threatened legal action against any buyer 
Menatep Yukos main shareholders' group has also threatened legal action 
Yukos claims that it is being punished for the political ambitions of its founder Mikhail Khodorkovsky who is now in jail facing separate fraud charges 
It has been hit with more than bn in taxes and fines and many observers now say that the break up of the firm that accounts for of Russia's oil output is inevitable

Pan-European stock market Euronext has approached the London Stock Exchange LSE about possible takeover bid 
The approach is at an early stage and therefore does not require response at this point LSE said 
Talks with the European stock market and with rival bidder Deutsche Boerse will continue the LSE said 
Last week the group rejected bn bn takeover offer from Deutsche Boerse claiming that it undervalued the business 
LSE saw its shares surge to new high of in early trade following the announcement on Monday 
The offer follows widespread media speculation that Euronext would make an offer for LSE 
Experts now widely expect bidding war for Europe's biggest stock market which lists stocks with total capitalisation of trillion to break out 
Commentators say that deal with Euronext which owns the Liffe derivatives exchange in London and combines the Paris Amsterdam and Lisbon stock exchanges could potentially offer the LSE more cost savings than deal with Deutsche Boerse 
weekend report in the Telegraph had quoted an unnamed executive at Euronext as saying the group would make cash bid to trump Deutsche Boerse's offer 
Because we already own Liffe in London the cost savings available to us from merger are far greater than for Deutsche Boerse the newspaper quoted the executive as saying 
Euronext chief executive Jean-Francois Theodore is reported to have already held private talks with LSE's chief executive Clara Furse 
Further reports had suggested that Euronext could make an offer in excess of the LSE's share closing price on Friday 
However Euronext said it could not guarantee at this stage that firm offer would be made for LSE

swathe of figures have provided further evidence of slowdown in the UK property market 
The Council of Mortgage Lenders CML British Bankers Association BBA and Building Societies Association BSA all said mortgage lending was slowing 
CML figures showed gross lending fell by in November as the number of people buying new homes fell 
Elsewhere the BBA added underlying mortgage lending rose by in November compared to October's 
The CML said that loans for new property purchases fell year-on-year to the lowest total seen since February 
Data from the CML showed lending fell to just over bn in November from bn year earlier 
Separate figures from the Building Societies Association showed the value of mortgage approvals -- loans agreed but not yet made -- stood lower than at the same time last year at seasonally-adjusted bn 
The figures come hot on the heels of new data from property website Rightmove which suggested owners must indulge in winter sale and slash prices by up to 
Miles Shipside commercial director at Rightmove said sellers would have to be more realistic with their asking prices to tempt buyers 
The average asking price of home fell by more than from in November to in December while the length of time it takes to sell home rose to days from in the summer 
Rightmove said estate agents were set to enter with third more properties on their books than year ago 
Even once the quieter holiday period is over sellers will find themselves competing with lot of other properties on the market 
In any business excess supply and low demand means one thing cut prices Mr Shipside said 
The proof is that some properties that have been appropriately discounted are selling even in the current market 
Overall asking prices have fallen from their July peaks as the equivalent of has been cut from an average property

It's fairly consistent picture showing that mortgage demand has fallen back again which is consistent with continuing correction in the housing market Investec economist Philip Shaw said

Yukos will return to US court on Wednesday to seek sanctions against Baikal Finance Group the little-known firm which has bought its main asset 
Yukos has said it will sue Baikal and others involved in the sale of Yuganskneftegas for bn in damages 
Yukos' US lawyers will attempt to have Baikal assets frozen after the Russian government ignored US court order last week blocking the sale 
Baikal's background and its motives for buying the unit are still unclear 
Russian newspapers have claimed that Baikal which bought the Yuganskneftegas production unit for bn bn roubles bn on Sunday at state provoked auction has strong links with Surgutneftegas Russia's fourth-biggest oil producer 
Many observers believe that the unit which produces of Yukos' oil output could ultimately fall into the hands of Surgutneftegas or even Gazprom the state gas firm which opted out of the auction 
The Russian government forced the sale of Yukos' most lucrative asset as part of its action to enforce bn back tax bill it says the company owes 
Yukos' US lawyers claim the auction was illegal because the firm had filed for bankruptcy and therefore its assets were now under the protection of US bankruptcy law which has worldwide jurisdiction 
On Wednesday Yukos will also seek further legal remedies to prevent the break-up of the group 
We believe the auction was illegal and we intend to pursue all legal recourses available to us Yukos spokesman Mike Lake told Agence France Press 
If it exports that oil it will be marketing stolen product he added 
The future ownership of Yuganksneftegas remains unclear amid widespread suggestions that Baikal was established as front for other interests 
Speaking on Tuesday President Putin said Baikal was owned by individual investors who planned to build relationships with other Russian energy firms interested in the development of Yuganskneftegas 
President Putin also suggested that China's National Petroleum Corporation could play role in the unit's future after signing commercial agreement with Gazprom to work on joint energy projects 
Yukos has claimed that the sale of its main asset will lead to the collapse of the company

It is America's second largest financial institution 
Recent investigations have exposed extensive accounting errors at Fannie Mae which supplies funds to America's trillion mortgage market 
Last week the firm was admonished by the Securities and Exchange Commission which said it had made major errors in its financial reporting

Although not making loans directly to buyers Fannie Mae is the largest single player in the mortgage market underwriting half of all US house purchases

Three years after Argentina was hit by deadly economic crisis there is fresh hope 
The country's economy is set to grow about this year after seeing growth last year sharp turnaround from when output fell 
The unemployment rate is improving too It is set to slip below by the end of the year down from in May 
True problems remain but the overall picture is one of vast improvement 
Even the International Monetary Fund IMF admits this 
The Argentine authorities are proud should be proud of the strong performance of the economy Thomas Dawson an IMF director said earlier this month 
Argentina has made remarkable recovery from hideous and lengthy recession which in culminated in the government halting debt repayments to its private creditors 
The debt default sparked deep and prolonged economic crisis which at least initially was made worse by the government's decisions 
Pension payments were halted and bank accounts frozen as part of austerity measures introduced by the government to deal with the country's massive debts 
In response angry crowds of ordinary Argentines took to the streets where dozens of lives were lost in clashes with the police 
Two presidents and at least three finance minister resigned in less than month 
Argentina was on the brink of collapse 
The fix was found in the currency markets with the abandonment of the peso's decade-long peg to the US dollar in February 
The subsequent devaluation saw thousands of people's life savings disappear 
Scathes of companies went bust 
Three years ago every sector of the economy was hit by the crisis said entrepreneur Drayton Valentine 
It really was dire 
But since then the general mood on the ground has improved dramatically in part because the devaluation helped attract fresh direct investment from abroad and stimulate business within Brazil 
Agriculture and tourism are helping said entrepreneur Drayton Valentine 
Mr Valentine who was born in the United States but grew up in Argentina was fortunate At the time of the crisis his savings were held in dollar accounts abroad 
But now he is using his money to help with the start-up trading company 
He explained that initially his firm is going to export building materials to Spain and United States 
Then he would like to diversify to other areas depending on the market 
Locally there is sense of recovery many companies are exporting now he said noting that lot of firms which were closed during the crisis are re-opening 
But not all that shines is gold 
Argentina is still burdened by its failure to pay private creditors at the end of 
President Nestor Kirchner's administration is still trying to hammer out an agreement with the creditors but with the debts' nominal value standing at around bn it is not proving easy 
Debt defaults make further lending agreements both difficult and expensive to negotiate 
Argentina's current offer implies that the creditors would get just cents for each dollar they are owed according to the creditors 
Understandably they want more and until they do both they and others are loath to continue lending 
For President Kirchner this proves hopeless challenge 
Real losses have been suffered and somebody has to pay observed Jack Boorman adviser to IMF's managing director Rodrigo Rato 
Everyone needs to keep in mind the enormous cost on the part of both creditors and the Argentine society and people that will have been endured by the time settlement is reached he said 
The cost is enormous and continues to be paid and will not be reversed by any restructuring 

With the international negotiations being troubled it is of little help to President Kirchner that the domestic situation remains strained as well 
This is partly because there are still bank account holders who are waiting to recover some of their deposits 
The situation is bad for those who had previously chosen to save in Argentina said Carlos Baez Silva president of AARA an association that represents bank account and bond holders 
Few people have recovered more than about half their savings Mr Baez Silva estimated pointing out that many of the savers who have lost out are pensioners or others who once trusted the government people who set aside money for the future in the belief that their investment would be safe 
lot of them invested in good faith he said 
The Argentine state responded by taking most of their investments 
The affair has made Mr Baez Silva disillusioned with the country's legal system 
On occasion the Supreme Court has ruled against the interests of the people he represents he says insisting that the system cannot be trusted 
People have to deposit their money in the banks not necessarily because they trust them but because crime is so high that people cannot have their money in their homes beneath their mattresses 
Mr Valentine who was born in the United States but grew up in Argentina agreed 
If have to save pesos the local currency there is not much problem but will think twice before deposit dollars in bank

Disney failed to tell investors that between and it employed three adult children of three then directors 
The firm has neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing in the settlement

Their children were paid between and year with shareholders not being informed 
The SEC also found that Disney did not disclose that Disney-owned subsidiary company Lifetime employed the wife of current Disney director John Bryson and that she earned more than year 
Louise Bryson remains with Lifetime 
Disney also failed to disclose payments to Air Shamrock an airline owned by Mr Gold and fellow former Disney directors Roy Disney 
Finally Disney also did not reveal that it provided more than annually for office space secretarial services and leased car and driver to former director Thomas Murphy

Russia's president has defended the purchase of Yukos' key production unit by state-owned oil firm Rosneft saying it followed free market principles 
Vladimir Putin said it was quite within the rights of state-owned company to ensure its interests were met 
Rosneft bought of Baikal Finance Group in move that amounts to the renationalisation of major chunk of Russia's booming oil industry 
Rosneft will now control about of Russia's total crude oil output 
Yukos share jumped in Moscow climbing as much as before being suspended 
Rosneft is already in the process of merging with Gazprom the world's biggest gas company move that will see Gazprom return to majority state-ownership 
Baikal was the surprise buyer of oil and gas giant Yukos's main production division at forced auction on Sunday 
Everything was done by market methods Mr Putin said at his year-end press conference in Moscow 
Shedding some light on the Kremlin's motivation Mr Putin referred to period of so-called cowboy capitalism that followed the collapse of the Soviet Union 
He said privatisations carried out in the early had involved trickery including law breaking by people seeking to acquire valuable state property 
Now the state using market methods is safeguarding its interests 
think this is quite normal the Russian president said 
Rosneft spokesman has said the acquisition is part of its plan to build balanced national energy corporation 

The latest announcement comes after more than year of wrangling that has pushed Yukos one of Russia's biggest companies to the brink of collapse 
The Russian government put Yukos's Yuganskneftegas subsidiary up for sale last week after hitting the company with bn bn bill for back taxes and fines 
Analysts say that Yukos's legal attempts to block the auction by filing for bankruptcy protection in the US are probably what caused this week's cloak-and-dagger dealings 
Gazprom the company originally tipped to buy Yuganskneftegas was banned from taking part in the auction by US court injunction 
By selling the Yukos unit to little-known Baikal and then to Rosneft Russia is able to circumvent host of tricky legal landmines analysts said 
You cannot sue the Russian government said Eric Kraus strategist at Moscow's Sovlink Securities 
The Russian government has sovereign immunity 
The government is renationalising Yuganskneftegas 

Even so analysts reckon that the saga still has long way to go 
The Rosneft announcement came just hours after Yukos accused Gazprom of illegally taking part in Sunday's auction 
It has said it will be seeking damages of bn 
The claim was made at the latest hearing in the US bankruptcy court in Houston Texas where Yukos had filed for Chapter bankruptcy protection 
If found in contempt of the US court order blocking the auction Gazprom could face having foreign assets seized 
Yukos' lawyers had also been expected to try to have Baikal's assets frozen 
Lawyers claimed the auction was illegal because Yukos with an office in Houston had filed for bankruptcy and therefore its assets were under the protection of US law which has worldwide jurisdiction 
Further muddying the waters is merger between Rosneft and Gazprom which authorities have said will go ahead as planned

The US stock market regulator is investigating troubled insurance broker Marsh McLennan's shareholder transactions the firm has said 
The Securities and Exchange Commission has asked for information about transactions involving holders of or more of the firm's shares 
Marsh has said it is co-operating fully with the SEC investigation 
Marsh is also the focus of an inquiry the New York attorney-general into whether insurers rigged the market 
Since that inquiry was launched in October Marsh has replaced its chief executive and held boardroom shake-out to meet criticism by lessening the number of company executives on the board 
Prosecutors allege that Marsh the world's biggest insurance broker and other US insurance firms may have fixed bids for corporate cover 
This is the issue at the heart of the inquiry by New York's top law officer Eliot Spitzer and separate prosecution of five insurers by the State of California 
The SEC's investigation into so-called related party transactions includes dealings in the Trident Funds managed by MMC Capital the company's private equity firm 
Marsh's new chief executive Michael Cherkasky is trying to negotiate settlement with Mr Spitzer 
Mr Spitzer has built up reputation as fierce critic and campaigner against corporate America's misdeeds 
The uncertainty unleashed by the scandal has prompted three credit rating agencies Standard Poor's Moody's and Fitch to downgrade Marsh in recent weeks 
According to the Financial Times insurance analysts are now questioning whether Marsh will be able to maintain its strong record of earning growth as they draw up forecasts for the first quarter of next year 
Doubts also exist over how much the company may have to pay regulators and lawyers to put the scandal behind

former executive at the London offices of Merrill Lynch has lost her sex discrimination case against the US investment bank 
An employment tribunal dismissed Stephanie Villalba's allegations of sexual discrimination and unequal pay 
But the -year-old won her claim of unfair dismissal resulting from her sacking in August 
Her partial victory is likely to cap her compensation to about tiny fraction of what she asked for 
The extent of damages will be assessed in the New Year 
The action the biggest claim heard by an employment tribunal in the UK had been viewed as something of test case 
The tribunal decided that Ms Villalba had been unfairly dismissed because having been removed from senior post she was entitled to wait to see if suitable alternative position could be found in the organisation 
Ms Villalba the former head of Merrill's private client business in Europe has made no decision on whether to appeal 
spokesman for her lawyers described the decision as very disappointing but pointed to some criticism of Merrill's procedures within the lengthy judgement 
The tribunal upheld Ms Villalba's claim of victimisation on certain specific issues including bullying e-mails in connection with contract but said it found no evidence of laddish culture at the bank 
We said from the start that this case was about performance not gender Merrill said in statement 
Ms Villalba was removed by the very same person who had promoted her into the position and who then replaced her with another woman 
Merrill Lynch is dedicated to creating true meritocracy where every employee has the opportunity to advance based on their skills and hard work 

Based in London's financial district Ms Villalba worked for Merrill's global private client business in Europe investing funds for some of Merrill's most important customers 
But in her employers told her she had no future after years with the company and she was made redundant 
Merrill Lynch denied Ms Villalba's claims and said she was removed from her post because of the extensive losses the firm was suffering on the continent 
The firm had told the tribunal that Ms Villalba's division had been losing about week 
Merrill said Ms Villalba lacked the leadership skills to turn around the unit

The move follows angry protests after the firm said previous compensation fund was running out of money 
subsequent New South Wales state inquiry criticised Hardie's actions 
In September the inquiry found that the company had misled the public about the amount of money set aside to cover its asbestos-related liabilities sparking the resignation of its then chief executive Peter MacDonald 
Campaigners welcomed news of the preliminary agreement

At the end of the day we are dealing with compensation for people who are terminally ill 
We don't know exactly how many of them there will be we don't know over what exact period they will fall ill she said 
However the deal still has to receive the approval of Hardie's shareholders 
Hardie which currently makes more than of its revenues in the US was once Australia's biggest supplier of asbestos building materials 
In the company set up fund to compensate asbestos victims but it later admitted the fund was running short of money 
decision by Hardie to move its headquarters to the Netherlands while remaining listed company in Australia provoked damaging public outcry 
Victims groups accusing it of trying to escape its responsibilities by moving abroad charge the company denies

Venezuela the world's fifth largest oil exporter sells about of its output to the United States 
Mr Chavez's administration which has strained relationship with the US is trying to diversify sales to reduce its dependence on its largest export market

The dollar has fallen to new record low against the euro after data fuelled fresh concerns about the US economy

The dollar has weakened sharply since September when it traded about amid continuing worries over the levels of the US trade and budget deficits 
Meanwhile France's finance minister has said the world faced economic catastrophe unless the US worked with Europe and Asia on currency controls 
Herve Gaymard said he would seek action on the issue at the next meeting of countries in February 
Ministers from European and Asian governments have recently called on the US to strengthen the dollar saying the excessively high value of the euro was starting to hurt their export-driven economies 
It's absolutely essential that at the meeting of the our American friends understand that we need coordinated management at the world level said Mr Gaymard 
Thursday's new low for the dollar came after data was released showing year-on-year sales of new homes in the US had fallen in November with some analysts saying this could indicate problems ahead for consumer activity 
Commerce Department data also showed consumer spending which drives two thirds of the US economy grew just last month 
The figure was weaker than forecast and fell short of the rise in October 
The official US policy is that it supports strong dollar but many market observers believe it is happy to let the dollar fall because of the boost to its exporters 
The US government has faced pressure from exporter organisations which have publicly stated the currency still has further to fall from abnormal and dangerous heights set in 
The US says it will let market forces determine the dollar's strength rather than intervene directly 
Statements from President Bush in recent weeks highlighting his aim to cut the twin US deficits have prompted slight upturns in the currency

For Thailand that figure is much lower at 
Governments are expected to take steps such as cutting taxes and increasing spending to facilitate recovery 
With the enormous displacement of people 
there will be serious relaxation of fiscal policy Glenn Maguire chief economist for the region at Societe Generale told Agence France Presse

Munich Re the world's largest reinsurance company said that its exposure is less than euros

spokeswoman for Hanover Re Europe's fifth-largest reinsurance firm estimated tsunami-related damage claims would be in the low double-digit millions of euros 
The company has paid out about million euros to cover damage caused recently by four major hurricanes in the US 
But insurers have not had long to assess the economic impact of the damage and reports of more casualties and destruction are still coming through 
So many things are unclear it is just too early to tell said Serge Troeber deputy head of Swiss Re's natural disasters department 
You need very complicated processes to estimate damages 
Unlike the hurricanes you can't just run model

Allianz leading German insurer said it did not know yet what its exposure would be 
However it said the tidal waves were unlikely to have significant impact on its business 
Zurich Financial said they could not yet assess the cost of the disaster 
The impact on US insurance companies is not expected to be heavy analysts said 
Most US insurers have relatively little exposure to Asia and those that do pass on lot of the risk to reinsurance companies or special catastrophe funds 
Insured damage could be fraction of the billions of dollars worth of destruction in Sri Lanka India Thailand Indonesia the Maldive Islands and Malaysia said Prudential Equity Group insurance analyst Jay Gelb 
US insurers are likely to have only minimal to no exposure 
It's more likely the Bermuda-based reinsurance companies might have some exposure said Paul Newsome an insurance analyst at AG Edwards Co 
Many of the affected countries such as Indonesia Sri Lanka or the Maldives do not usually buy insurance for these kinds of disasters said US-based insurance expert 
Early estimates from the World Bank put the amount of aid needed for the worst affected countries including Sri Lanka India Indonesia and Thailand at about bn bn similar to the cash offered to Central America after Hurricane Mitch

The US government is to investigate two airlines- US Airways and Delta Air Lines' Comair subsidiary after travel chaos over the Christmas weekend 
Staff calling in sick at US Airways and computer failures at Comair left passengers stranded and pieces of baggage undelivered 
US Airways is in Chapter bankruptcy protection for the second time in two years and battling to cut costs 
It is currently trying to negotiate pay cuts with flight and baggage staff 
Transportation Secretary Norman Mineta said he was deeply concerned at the disruption to passengers and ordered thorough investigation 
Comair's computer breakdown plunged its flight-crew scheduling system into disarray 
Altogether some flights were cancelled over the holiday long weekend 
Mr Mineta said it was important to understand what happened why it happened and whether the carriers properly planned for the holiday travel period and responded appropriately to consumer needs in the aftermath 
Adding to the atmosphere of chaos were mountains of luggage left to pile up when third of US Airways' baggage handling staff called in sick 
There was also shortage of US Airways flight attendants with nearly fifth saying they were too sick to work leading to many flight cancellations 
However union officials denied there had been deliberate sickout 
They said that many people have flu at this time of year and that the airline is chronically understaffed 
US Airways ended up cancelling over flights on Christmas Day stranding passengers in as many as airports 
Ground crews at US Airways the seventh-largest US airline which is now in Chapter bankruptcy protection face court-imposed pay cut next month 
The airline needs to negotiate other paycuts if it is to find route out of bankruptcy 
It is looking for paycuts totalling 
US Airways has full-scale employee mutiny on its hands commented Michael Boyd an industry consultant 
Disruptions to flight schedules could discourage customers from flying with US Airways reducing revenues 
US Airways had to cancel approximately flights on Thursday on Friday on Saturday on Sunday and on Monday said industry officials 
The airline said it was embarrassed by the situation and deeply regrets any inconvenience caused to customers The probe will focus on the industry's compliance with agreement aimed at improving the quality of passenger service that has so far allowed airlines to avoid congressionally-mandated standards 
Analysts said the Christmas chaos cast doubt on US Airway's ability to emerge from bankruptcy and was likely to worsen the finances of troubled Delta parent of Comair

LG Card almost collapsed in due to an increase in overdue credit card bills after the bursting of credit bubble 
The firm returned to profit in September but now needs capital injection to avoid being delisted from the Korea Stock Exchange 
The exchange can delist company if its debt exceeds its assets for two years running 
LG card's creditors fear that such move would triggered massive debt redemption requests that could bankrupt the firm which owes about bn

Light crude oil futures fell to barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange Nymex and have now lost in five days 
Nonetheless US crude is still more expensive than at the beginning of boosted by growing demand and bottlenecks at refineries 
Traders ignored the possible effects of Asia's tidal waves on global supplies 
Instead the focus is now on US consumption which is heavily influenced in the short term by the weather 
With the revised milder temperatures 
I'm more inclined to think we'll push lower and test the range said John Brady of ABN AMRO 
The market definitely feels to be on the defensive 
Statistics released last week showed that stockpiles of oil products in the US had risen an indication that severe supply disruptions may not arise this winter barring any serious incident

Governments aid agencies insurers and travel firms are among those counting the cost of the massive earthquake and waves that hammered southern Asia 
The worst-hit areas are Sri Lanka India Indonesia and Thailand with at least people killed 
Early estimates from the World Bank put the amount of aid needed at about bn bn similar to the cash offered Central America after Hurricane Mitch 
Mitch killed about people and caused damage of about bn in 
World Bank spokesman Damien Milverton told the Wall Street Journal that he expected an aid package of financing and debt relief 
Tourism is vital part of the economies of the stricken countries providing jobs for million people in the south east Asian region according to the World Travel and Tourism Council WTTC 
In the Maldives islands in the Indian ocean two-thirds of all jobs depend on tourism 
But the damage covers fishing farming and businesses too with hundreds of thousands of buildings and small boats destroyed by the waves 
International agencies have pledged their support most say it is impossible to gauge the extent of the damage yet 
The International Monetary Fund IMF has promised rapid action to help the governments of the stricken countries cope 
The IMF stands ready to do its part to assist these nations with appropriate support in their time of need said managing director Rodrigo Rato 
Only Sri Lanka and Bangladesh currently receive IMF support while Indonesia the quake's epicentre has recently graduated from IMF assistance 
It is up to governments to decide if they want IMF help 
Other agencies such as the Asian Development Bank have said that it is too early to comment on the amount of aid needed 
There is no underestimating the size of the problem however 
The United Nations' emergency relief coordinator Jan Egeland said that this may be the worst national disaster in recent history because it is affecting so many heavily populated coastal areas 
so many vulnerable communities 
Many people will have had their livelihoods their whole future destroyed in few seconds 
He warned that the longer term effects many be as devastating as the tidal wave or the tsunami itself because of the risks of epidemics from polluted drinking water 
Insurers are also struggling to assess the cost of the damage but several big players believe the final bill is likely to be less than the bn cost of the hurricanes that battered the US earlier this year 
The region that's affected is very big so we have to check country-by-country what the situation is said Serge Troeber deputy head of the natural disasters department at Swiss Re the world's second biggest reinsurance firm 
should assume however that the overall dimension of insured damages is below the storm damages of the US he said 
Munich Re the world's biggest reinsurer said This is primarily human tragedy 
It is too early for us to state what our financial burden will be 
Allianz has said it sees no significant impact on its profitability 
However low insurance bill may simply reflect the general poverty of much of the region rather than the level of economic devastation for those who live there 
The International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies told the Reuters news agency that it was seeking for emergency aid 
The biggest health challenges we face is the spread of waterborne diseases particularly malaria and diarrhoea the aid agency was quoted as saying 
The European Union has said it will deliver euros of aid according to the Wall Street Journal 
The EU's Humanitarian Aid Commissioner Louis Michel was quoted as saying that it was key to bring aid in those vital hours and days immediately after the disaster 
Other countries also are reported to have pledged cash while the US State Department said it was examining what aid was needed in the region 
Getting companies and business up and running also may play vital role in helping communities recover from the weekend's events 
Many of the worst-hit areas such as Sri Lanka Thailand's Phuket island and the Maldives are popular tourist resorts that are key to local economies 
December and January are two of the busiest months for the travel in southern Asia and the damage will be even more keenly felt as the industry was only just beginning to emerge from post slump 
Growth has been rapid in southeast Asia with the World Tourism Organisation figures showing increase in tourist revenues in the region during the first months of 
In southern Asia that expansion is 
India continues to post excellent results thanks to increased promotion and product development but also to the upsurge in business travel driven by the rapid economic development of the country the WTO said 
Arrivals to other destinations such as 
Maldives and Sri Lanka also thrived 
In Thailand tourism accounts for about of the country's annual gross domestic product or about bn 
In Singapore the figure is close to 
Tourism also brings in much needed foreign currency

Thailand has become the first of the southern Asian nations battered by giant waves at the weekend to cut its economic forecast 
Thailand's economy is now expected to grow by in rather than as forecast before tsunamis hit six tourist provinces 
The full economic costs of the disaster remain unclear 
In part this is because of its scale and because delivering aid and recovering the dead remain priorities 
But Indonesian Indian and Hong Kong stock markets reached record highs on Wednesday suggesting that investors do not fear major economic impact 
The highs showed the gap in outlook between investors in large firms and individuals who have lost their livelihoods 
Investors seemed to feel that some of the worst-affected areas such as Aceh in Indonesia were so under-developed that the tragedy would little impact on Asia's listed companies according to analysts 
Obviously with lot of loss of life lot of time is needed to clean up the mess bury the people and find the missing 
But it's not necessarily really big thing in the economic sense said ABN Amro chief Asian strategist Eddie Wong 
India's Bombay Stock Exchange inched slightly above its previous record close on Wednesday 
Expectations of strong corporate earnings in drove the Indonesian stock exchange in Jakarta to record high on Wednesday 
In Hong Kong the Hang Seng index may be benefiting in part from the potential for its listed property companies to gain from rebuilding contracts in the tsunami-affected regions of South East Asia

Thailand may lose bn baht in earnings from tourism over the next three months according to tourism minister Sontaya Kunplome 
In the affected provinces he expects the loss of tourism revenue to be offset by government reconstruction spending 
Thailand intends to spend similar sum around bn baht on the rebuilding work 
It will take until the fourth quarter of next year before tourist visitors in Phuket and five other provinces return to their normal level said Naris Chaiyasoot director general at the ministry's fiscal policy office 
In the Maldives the cost of reconstruction could wipe out economic growth according to government spokesman 
Our nation is in peril here said Ahmed Shaheed the chief government spokesman

The Maldives has gross domestic product of 
It won't be surprising if the cost exceeds our GDP he said

German investment bank Deutsche Bank has challenged the right of Yukos to claim bankruptcy protection in the US 
In court filing on Tuesday it said the Russian oil giant has few Texas ties beyond bank accounts and Texas-based finance chief 
Deutsche Bank claimed Yukos had artificially manufactured legal case to stop the sale of its main asset 
It had wanted to help fund Gazprom's plans for bn bn bid for Yukos unit Yuganskneftegas 
Deutsche Bank would have earned large fees from the deal which could not be carried out because US chapter bankruptcy rules made the Kremlin's auction of Yuganskneftegas on December illegal under US law 
But the US bankruptcy court judge in Texas granted Yukos an injunction that barred Gazprom and its lenders from taking part 
Yuganskneftegas will ultimately end up with Gazprom 
The winning bidder at the auction was previously unknown firm Baikal Finance Group which was snapped up days later by Rosneft Russian oil firm that is in the process of merging with Gazprom 
The effect of these transactions is to renationalise Yuganskneftegas 
Deutsche Bank contends Yukos filed for bankruptcy earlier this month in Texas in desperate and unsuccessful bid to stave off the December auction of its top unit by the Russian government which was in tax dispute with Yukos 
This blatant attempt to artificially manufacture basis for jurisdiction constitutes cause to dismiss this case Deutsche Bank said in its court filing 
Mike Lake spokesman for Yukos' lawyers said on Tuesday that the company stands by its legal action 
Yukos is confident of its right to US bankruptcy protection and we are prepared to be back in court defending that position again he said 
Yukos has said it intends to seek bn in damages from the buyer of Yuganskneftegas once the sale finally goes through 
In its filing Deutsche Bank said Houston was jurisdiction in which Yukos owns no real or personal property and conducts no business operations 

It also said the US bankruptcy court should not become involved in tax dispute between the Federation and one of its corporate citizens 
It suggested the European Court or an international arbitration tribunal were more appropriate jurisdictions for the legal fight between Russia and Yukos 
The next hearing in the bankruptcy is expected on January 
Analysts believe the tax dispute between the Russian government and Yukos is partly driven by Russian president Vladimir Putin's hostility hostility to the political ambitions of ex-Yukos boss Mikhail Khordokovsky 
Mr Khodorkovsky is in jail and on trial for fraud and tax evasion

Fiat will meet car giant General Motors GM on Tuesday in an attempt to reach agreement over the future of the Italian firm's loss-making auto group 
Fiat claims that GM is legally obliged to buy the of the car unit it does not already own GM says the contract signed in is no longer valid 
Press reports have speculated that Fiat may be willing to accept cash payment in return for dropping its claim 
Both companies want to cut costs as the car industry adjusts to waning demand 
The meeting between Fiat boss Sergio Marchionne and GM's Rick Wagoner is due to take place at GMT in Zurich according to the Reuters news agency 
Mr Marchionne is confident of his firm's legal position saying in an interview with the Financial Times that GM's argument has no legs 
The agreement in question dates back to GM's decision to buy of Fiat's auto division in 
At the time it gave the Italian firm the right via 'put option' to sell the remaining stake to GM 
In recent weeks Fiat has reiterated its claims that this 'put' is still valid and legally binding 
However GM argues that Fiat share sale made last year which cut GM's holding to together with asset sales made by Fiat have terminated the agreement 
Selling the Fiat's car-making unit may not prove so simple analysts say especially as it is company that is so closely linked to Italy's industrial heritage 
Political and public pressure may well push the two firms to reach compromise 
We are not expecting Fiat to exercise its put of the auto business against an unwilling GM at this point brokerage Merrill Lynch said in note to investors adding that any legal battle would be protracted and damaging to the business 
As far as we are aware the Agnelli family which indirectly controls at least of Fiat has not given firm public indication that it wants to sell the auto business 
Fiat may be willing to cancel the 'put' in exchange for money

Analysts said the defence documents provided more details on WMC and may trigger possible rival bid 
If bid is going to emerge it is probably likely in the next one to two weeks said Daiwa Securities analyst Mark Pervan 
He said the valuation would put increased pressure on Xstrata to look at sweetening its offer 
Marc Gonsalves an executive at Xstrata said We will review the information contained in the target's statement over the next week or so 
He added While we will review the assumptions made by Grant Samuel in detail we are extremely sceptical of their conclusion and suggest that WMC shareholders take extreme care in presuming that these optimistic assumptions are capable of being realised

Cash-strapped US companies including those in the airline car-making and steel industries had argued in favour of the rule change claiming that funding the insurance premiums adequately would force them to have to cut jobs

Workers will be permitted to request staying on beyond this compulsory retirement age although employers will have the right to refuse 
Trade and Industry Secretary Patricia Hewitt said people would not be forced to work longer than they wanted saying the default age was not statutory compulsory retirement age 
She said employers would be free to continue employing people for as long as they were competent 
Under age discrimination proposals from the Department of Trade and Industry last year workers were to be allowed to work on till if they wished 
Business leaders had opposed the plan as they said it would be too costly and cumbersome 
The British Chambers of Commerce welcomed the latest proposal 
This move today is the best of both worlds it said 
Employers have the ability to define the end point of the employer-employee relationship and employees have flexibility with right to request to work past the age of

The German lender is one of six banks that were barred from providing financing to Gazprom the Russian state-owned company that was expected to win the auction for Yuganskneftegas 
Deutsche Bank which is also an advisor to Gazprom has called on the US court to overturn its decision to provide Yukos with bankruptcy protection 
Lifting the injunction would remove the uncertainty that surrounds the court case and clarify Deutsche Bank's business position analysts said 
Analysts are not optimistic about Yukos' chances in court 
Russian President Vladimir Putin and the country's legal authorities have repeatedly said that the US has no jurisdiction over Yukos and its legal wranglings 
On top of that the firm only has limited assets in the US 
Yukos has won small victories however and is bullish about its chances in court 
Do we have an ability to influence what happens 
We think we do said Mike Lake Yukos spokesman 
The litigation risks are real said Credit Suisse First Boston analyst Vadim Mitroshin The dispute with the Russian authorities is partly driven by President Putin's clampdown on the political ambitions of ex-Yukos boss Mikhail Khodorkovsky

Blake Lee-Harwood campaigns director at Greenpeace in the UK said It's fairly meaningless to talk about your company's direction in terms of sustainability without having detailed knowledge of your supply chain 
It's also important to get some kind of independent assessment of your reporting 

Less than quarter of companies get their corporate social responsibility CSR reports independently verified to provide assurances they are accurate and complete says the survey 
To date there are no set standards for non-financial reporting although the Global Reporting Initiative an independent pro-sustainability institution is planning to establish some 
The reports surveyed by Directions are published voluntarily 
They are usually called corporate social responsibility CSR reports sustainability reports or social and environmental reports 
Peter Knight director of Context says UK top companies reported for the first time this year and in general the quality of reports has improved 
The corporate lexicon of homilies generalities and soft assurances fluff is on its way out 
There are less pictures of smiling children and butterflies 
The UK government will soon require all quoted companies to report their social and environmental risks in chapter in their annual reports called the Operating and Financial Review 
The regulation is not expected until and the first reports under this scheme will not be published before 
The US seems to lag Europe in producing corporate social responsibility reports 
The majority of European top companies publish them and only of the US top

Sri Lanka faces bn bill in for reconstruction after the tsunami which killed more than of its people its central bank says 
This estimate is preliminary bank governor Sunil Mendis told reporters and could rise in 
The island state is asking for about from the International Monetary Fund to help pay for relief he said 
The bank has bn rupees set aside to lend at lower interest rate to those who lost property 
According to Mr Mendis half the IMF support could come from freeze on debt repayments which would free up resources immediately 
The rest could come from five-year emergency loan 
Sri Lanka is hoping for wider freeze from other creditors 
The Paris Club of creditors meets on January to discuss debt moratorium for the nations hit by the tsunami which ravaged south and east Asia on December 
Some people across the region are feared to be dead and millions have been left homeless and destitute 
full reckoning of the economic cost to Sri Lanka of the tsunami will not be clear for some time to come 
But already it looks likely that growth in the first half of will slow Mr Mendis told reporters although he would not say by how much 
One side-effect of the disaster has been that the value of the rupee has risen as foreign funds have flooded into the country 
The currency has strengthened since late December coming close to rupees to the US dollar for the first time in more than six months

India's biggest oil exploration firm Oil Natural Gas Corp ONGC says it is in talks to buy the former assets of troubled Russian crude producer Yukos 
We are in touch with the concerned Russian entities about the Yukos assets and other opportunities in Russia said ONGC chairman Subir Raha 
Local press had reported that ONGC was looking to buy of Yukos' former key oil production unit for bn bn 
Yukos is being broken up by Russian authorities to pay massive tax bill 
It was forced to sell its key production unit Yuganskneftegas Yugansk last month after being hit with bill of bn in unpaid taxes and fines 
State-owned Rosneft now owns Yugansk and Russia has said it will turn the oil producer into stand-alone firm 
Indian oil minister Mani Shankar Aiyar discussed ONGC's plans during trip to Moscow last year and the topic came up again during Russian president Vladimir Putin's recent visit to New Delhi 
It would make great sense for us to build on that said Mr Aiyar 
India's oil production has stagnated over recent years and it is having to look abroad to secure future supplies 
India imports about of its total oil consumption 
At the same time India's economy is booming and the country's thirst for oil is so strong that it has helped pushed up the price of crude worldwide 
India produces about barrels of oil per day bpd little changed since the start of the according to oil industry analysts Douglas-Westwood 
Consumption meanwhile has jumped to million bpd compared with bpd in 
For countries to develop they have to have access to energy said John Westwood managing director of oil industry analysts Douglas-Westwood 
India is dramatically growing economy that must have access to oil 
By buying into Yugansk ONGC would be able to reduce its dependence on Gulf states for oil imports Mr Westwood explained especially as the chances of finding and exploiting resources within India are slim 
We forecast that Indian production will go into significant decline Mr Westwood said 
By production may only be at half of today's levels 
ONGC which is majority-owned by the Indian state already has bought petroleum assets in countries including Vietnam Sudan and Russia 
The company is partner with Rosneft in the Sakhalin- oil field off Russia's Siberian coast 
ONGC is however not the only firm interested in Yugansk 
Chinese crude company China National Petroleum has also been mentioned as possible investor while on Thursday Italy refused to rule out an interest 
ONGC's interest is the latest twist in saga that has seen one of the world's biggest oil producers brought to its knees 
The dispute is partly driven by President Putin's clampdown on the political ambitions of ex-Yukos boss Mikhail Khodorkovsky who is currently in jail on charges of fraud and tax evasion 
Yukos has been battling the Russian authorities for more than year and has filed for bankruptcy protection in the US 
Analysts have questioned how long it can continue to survive without Yugansk 
On Thursday US court said it will hear arguments for Yukos' bankruptcy claim to be thrown out on February 
Should that happen Yukos will have little chance of clawing back its assets analysts said

It said it accepted full responsibility for what it called improper activities 
former senior manager at Monsanto directed an Indonesian consulting firm to give bribe to high-level official in Indonesia's environment ministry in 
The manager told the company to disguise an invoice for the bribe as consulting fees 
Monsanto was facing stiff opposition from activists and farmers who were campaigning against its plans to introduce genetically-modified cotton in Indonesia 
Despite the bribe the official did not authorise the waiving of the environmental study requirement

An executive at US insurance firm Marsh McLennan has pleaded guilty to criminal charges in connection with an ongoing fraud and bid-rigging probe 
New York Attorney General Elliot Spitzer said senior vice president Robert Stearns had pleaded guilty to scheming to defraud 
The offence carries sentence of months to four years in state prison 
Mr Spitzer's office added Mr Stearns had also agreed to testify in future cases during the industry inquiry 
We are saddened by the development Marsh said in statement 
The company added it would continue to co-operate in the case adding it was committed to resolving the company's legal issues and to serving our clients with the highest standards of transparency and ethics 
According to statement from Mr Spitzer's office the Marsh executive admitted he instructed insurance companies to submit non-competitive bids for insurance business between and 
Those bids were then conveyed to Marsh clients under false and fraudulent pretences 
Through the practice Marsh was allowed to determine which insurers won business from clients and so control the insurance market Mr Spitzer's office added 
It also protected incumbent insurers when their business was up for renewal and helped Marsh to maximise its fees statement said 
In one case an email showed Mr Stearns had instructed colleague to solicit non-competitive or quote from AIG that was higher in premium and more restrictive in coverage and so fixed the bids in way that would support the present provider Chubb 
The company is also still being examined by US stock market regulator the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC 
Late last month the SEC asked for information about transactions involving holders of or more of the firm's shares

US interest rates are expected to rise for the fifth time since June following the US Federal Reserve's latest rate-setting meeting later on Tuesday 
Borrowing costs are tipped to rise by quarter of percentage point to 
The move comes as recovery in the US economy the world's biggest shows signs of robustness and sustainability 
The dollar's record-breaking decline meanwhile has spooked markets and along with high oil prices has raised concerns about the pace of inflation 
We are seeing evidence that inflation is moving higher said Ken Kim an analyst at Stone McCarthy Research 
It's not risk it's actually happening 
Mr Kim added that borrowing costs could rise further 
The Fed has said that it will move in measured way to combat price growth and lift interest rates from their -year lows that were prompted by sluggish US and global growth 
With the economic picture now looking more rosy the Fed has implemented quarter percentage point rises in June August September and November 
Although the US economy grew at an annual rate of in the three months to September analysts warn that Fed has to be careful not to move too aggressively and take the wind out of the recovery's sails 
Earlier this month figures showed that job creation is still weak while consumer confidence is subdued 
think the Fed feels it has fair amount of flexibility said David Berson chief economist at Fannie Mae 
While inflation has moved up it hasn't moved up lot 
If economic growth should subside 
the Fed would feel it has the flexibility to pause in its tightening 
But if economic growth picked up and caused core inflation to rise little more quickly think the Fed would be prepared to tighten more quickly as well

The UK's biggest mortgage lender said prices rose over the whole of but by only in the second half of the year 
The average price of house in the UK now stands at Halifax said 
The survey seems to fly in the face of recent evidence that the UK housing market has been slowing substantially in response to interest rate rises 
Last week the Nationwide said that house prices fell in December with annual inflation running at three year low 
On Tuesday figures from the Bank of England showed that the number of mortgages approved in the UK has fallen to the lowest level for nearly decade 
New loans in November fell to from in October the lowest rate since September the Bank of England said 
Growth in unsecured lending such as personal loans and credit cards also slowed last month 
Capital Economics which has in the past predicted sharp fall in UK house prices branded Halifax's findings temporary surprise which would be reversed over the coming months 
The month by month volatility of the Halifax house price data should not distract from the fact that there is clear downward trend in house prices Capital Economics statement said 
Experts believe five interest rate rises since November are cutting borrowers' appetite for debt 
Despite recording price rise in December the Halifax survey concluded that there was continuing signs of genuine slowdown in the housing market 
Martin Ellis Halifax chief economist said that there was no need to revise the bank's prediction made last month that prices would fall by in 
Sound housing market fundamentals will continue to underpin the market in ensuring that the market remains healthy and that house prices fall only slightly Mr Ellis said

Upscale department store Nordstrom said same store sales were higher than during the same period last year 
Trendy youth labels also sold well with sales jumping at young women's clothing retailer Bebe Stores and at American Eagle Outfitters 
But Wal-Mart only saw its sales rise after it cut prices 
The company saw rise in December sales less than the rise seen year earlier 
Customers at the world's biggest retailer are generally seen to be the most vulnerable to America's economic woes 
Commentators claim many have cut back on spending amid uncertainty over job security while low and middle-income Americans have reined in spending in the face of higher gasoline prices

UK-based bank Standard Chartered said it would spend bn bn to buy one of South Korea's main retail banks 
Standard Chartered said acquiring Korea First Bank KFB fulfilled strategic objective of building bigger presence in Asia's third largest economy 
Its shares fell nearly in London as the bank raised funds for the deal by selling new stocks worth bn bn equal to of its share capital 
Standard Chartered expects about of future group revenue to come from KFB 
The South Korean bank will also make up of the group's total assets 
The move year after Citigroup beat Standard Chartered to buy Koram bank would be the South Korean financial sector's biggest foreign takeover 
This time around Standard Chartered is thought to have beaten HSBC to the deal 
KFB is South Korea's seventh largest bank with million retail customers of the country's banking market and an extensive branch network 
The country's banking market is three times the size of Hong Kong's with annual revenues of bn 
Standard Chartered has its headquarters in London but does two thirds of its business in Asia and much of the rest in Africa 
We're comfortable with the price paid 
the key here has been speed and decisiveness in making sure that we won said Standard Chartered chief executive Mervyn Davies at London press conference 
Standard Chartered said KFB was well-managed conservatively run bank with highly skilled workforce and represented significant acquisition in growth market 
In London Standard Chartered's sale of million new shares to institutional investors pushed its share price down and contributing to the FTSE 's decline 
Standard Chartered's shares were pence lower at by midday 
Some analysts also queried whether Standard Chartered had overpaid for KFB 
The deal which requires regulatory approval is expected to be completed by April and to be earnings accretive in Standard Chartered said 
Rival banking giant HSBC which is based in London and Hong Kong was also in the running 
Standard Chartered is believed to have gained the initiative by putting together bid during the Christmas break 
They were able to move so quickly it caught HSBC by surprise the Financial Times newspaper quoted an insider in the talks as saying 
HSBC will now have to wait for the next South Korean bank in line to be sold off thought likely to be Korea Exchange Bank also currently in the hands of US group 
Standard Chartered said it was buying of KFB an agreement that would bring an end to the bank's complex dual ownership 
The South Korean government owns of KFB while the remaining shareholding and operational control are in the hands of US private equity group Newbridge Capital 
Newbridge bought its stake during the government's nationalisation of several banks in the wake of the Asia-wide currency crisis which crippled South Korea's financial institutions 
South Korea's economy is expected to grow by this year 
Although often thought of an export-driven economy South Korea's service sector has overtaken manufacturing in the last decade or so 
Services now make up roughly of the economy and consumer spending and retail banking have become increasingly important 
In the aftermath of the Asian financial crisis the government encouraged the growth of consumer credit 
Bad loan problems followed LG Card the country's biggest credit card provider has been struggling to avoid bankruptcy for months for instance 
But analysts believe South Korea's financial services industry is still in its infancy offering plenty of scope for new products 
Standard Chartered sees the opportunity to create value by the introduction of more sophisticated banking products 
Since KFB has been restructured from wholesale bank into retail bank focused on mortgage lending which makes up of its loans

The budget for the fiscal year starting on March calls for the sell-off of of the state's corporate holdings 
Mr Khatami's second term as president ends on August making this his last budget 
But opposition from members of parliament who have attacked previous privatisations could block his plans 
Elections in May ousted many of Mr Khatami's supporters in parliament in favour of more hard-line religious conservatives 
Late last year they backed law which would give parliament veto over foreign investment 
The ruling was response to the involvement in telecoms and airport projects by Turkish companies which hardliners accused of doing business with Israel 
It came not long after the Expediency Council Iran's ultimate decision-maker blessed Mr Khatami's policy of selling stakes in sectors protected by the constitution such as energy transport telecoms and banking 
Continued obstruction of foreign investment could get in the way not only of privatisation plans but also of Mr Khatami's hope of modestly reducing the government's reliance on oil revenues

The European Commission EC has called truce in its battle with France and Germany over breaching deficit limits 
The move came after France and Germany vowed to run their budget deficits below the EU cap in for the first time in four years 
But the EC did warn the two were under close scrutiny and it would act if their fiscal situations deteriorated 
Under EU rules member countries must keep their deficits below 
France and Germany will breach that this year 
It will be the third year in row that the two countries have broken the European Union's Stability and Growth Pact rules 
The eurozone's two biggest economies left the pact in tatters in November when they persuaded fellow EU members to put the threat of penalties for deficit breaches on hold 
The commission then took the pair to the European Court of Human Justice which ruled EU countries could not put the pact in abeyance and confirmed the EC's right to launch excessive debt procedures 
After announcing its decision to erase France and Germany from its list of deficit rule breakers the EU said that the time lag created by the ruling meant that should be the target year for the pair to bring their budget's below 
The commission concludes that the two countries appear to be on track to correct their excessive deficits by it said in statement 
The EU expects the German deficit to fall to fall to of GDP next year from this year while France's is forecast to drop to from an expected this year 
The forecasts are based on EC predictions of GDP growth of in Germany next year and in France 
Berlin welcomed the decision with finance minister Hans Eichel saying it showed that the EC recognised Germany's fiscal policy was on the right track even amid very difficult economic conditions 
However Paris was more subdued with finance minister Herve Gaymard telling parliament We must continue along this path of saving money 
However the move still had its critics with the European People's Party EPP attacking the EC for backing down from punitive action 
The Commission is buckling under the pressure from Germany and France EPP spokesman Alexander Radwan said 
The scary fact is that budget sinners despite having repeatedly exceeded the deficit limit do not have to fear any sanctions 
Despite the commission delivering its decision on the two biggest eurozone economies it refused to comment on similar action against Greece which has also broken the deficit ceiling 
Monetary Affairs Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said that it was matter for next week

Eighteen former Enron directors have agreed settlement deal in shareholder lawsuit over the collapse of the energy firm 
Leading plaintiff the University of California announced the news adding that of the former directors will pay from their own pockets 
The settlement will be put to the courts for approval next week 
Enron went bankrupt in after it emerged it had hidden hundreds of millions of dollars in debt 
Before its collapse the firm was the seventh biggest public US company by revenue 
Its demise sent shockwaves through financial markets and dented investor confidence in corporate America 
The settlement is very significant in holding these outside directors at least partially personally responsible William Lerach the lawyer leading the class action suit against Enron said 
Hopefully this will help send message to corporate boardrooms of the importance of directors performing their legal duties he added 
Under the terms of the settlement of which will be covered by insurance none of the former directors will admit any wrongdoing 
The deal is the fourth major settlement negotiated by lawyers who filed class action on behalf of Enron's shareholders almost three years ago 
So far including the latest deal just under has been retrieved for investors 
However the latest deal does not include former Enron chief executives Ken Lay and Jeff Skilling 
Both men are facing criminal charges for their alleged misconduct in the run up to the firm's collapse 
Neither does it cover Andrew Fastow who has pleaded guilty to taking part in an illegal conspiracy while he was chief financial officer at the group 
Enron's shareholders are still seeking damages from long list of other big name defendants including the financial institutions JP Morgan Chase Citigroup Merrill Lynch and Credit Suisse First Boston

UK house prices dipped slightly in November the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister ODPM has said 
The average house price fell marginally to from in October 
Recent evidence has suggested that the UK housing market is slowing after interest rate increases and economists forecast drop in prices during 
But while the monthly figures may hint at cooling of the market annual house price inflation is still strong up in the year to November 
Economists however forecast that ODPM figures are likely to show weakening in annual house price growth in coming months 
Overall the housing market activity is slowing down and that is backed up by the mortgage lending and the mortgage approvals data said Mark Miller at HBOS Treasury Services 
The ODPM data is fairly lagging indicator 

The figures come after the Bank of England said the number of mortgages approved in the UK has fallen to the lowest level for nearly decade 
The Halifax meanwhile said last week that house prices increased by in December the first monthly rise since September 
The UK's biggest mortgage lender said prices rose over the whole of but by only in the second half of the year 
It is predicting fall in overall prices in as the market stabilises after large gains in recent years 
The ODPM attributed the monthly fall of prices in November to drop in the value of detached houses and flats 
It said annual inflation rose between October and November because prices had fallen by in the same period in 
The ODPM data showed the average house price was in England in Wales in Scotland and in Northern Ireland 
All areas saw rise in annual house price inflation in November except for Northern Ireland and the West Midlands where the rate was unchanged the ODPM said

The US created fewer jobs than expected in December but analysts said that the dip in hiring was not enough to derail the world's biggest economy 
According to Labor Department figures new jobs were added last month 
That took 's total to million the best showing in five years 
Job creation was one of last year's main concerns for the US economy 
While worries still remain the conditions are set for steady growth in analysts said 
The unemployment rate stayed at in December and about jobs will need to be created each month if that figure is to drop 
It was respectable report said Michael Moran analyst at Daiwa Securities 
Payroll growth in December was little lighter than the consensus forecast but we had upward revisions to the prior two months and an increase in manufacturing employment 
Manufacturing is cyclical area of the economy and if it's showing job growth it's good indication that the economy is on solid growth track 
That means that the Federal Reserve is likely to continue its policy of raising interest rates 
The Fed lifted borrowing costs five times last year to citing evidence the US economic recovery was becoming more robust 
Job creation was one of last year's main concerns for the US economy and proved to be main topic of debate in the US presidential election 
While demand for workers is far from booming the conditions are set for steady growth 
Overall compared to the previous year it looks great it just keeps going stronger and stronger and expect that to be the case in said Kurt Karl economist at Swiss Re in New York 
Meanwhile economists cautioned against reading too much into data from the Federal Reserve showing an unexpected bn drop in consumer debt in November 
fall in consumer spending which makes up about two-thirds of all US economic activity could help limit the extent of any future interest rate rises 
But economists said there could be number of reasons for fall in the borrowing which include credit cards and personal loans while noting that such figures can vary on month-to-month basis

Shell is to pay to the ex-finance chief who stepped down from her post in April after the firm over-stated its reserves 
Judy Boynton finally left the firm on December having spent the intervening time as special advisor to chief executive Jeroen van der Veer 
In January Shell told shocked investors that its reserves were smaller than previously thought 
Shell said the pay-off was in line with Ms Boynton's contract 
She was leaving by mutual agreement to pursue other career opportunities the firm said in statement 
The severance package means she keeps long-term share options but fails to collect on incentive plan since the firm has failed to meet the targets included in it 
The revelation that Shell had inflated its reserves led to the resignation of its chairman Sir Phil Watts and production chief Walter van der Vijver 
An investigation commissioned by Shell found that Ms Boynton had to share responsibility for the company's behaviour 
Despite receiving an email from Mr Van de Vijver which said the firm had fooled the market about its reserves the investigation said she did nothing to inquire further 
In all Shell restated its reserves four times during 
In September it paid in fines to regulators on both sides of the Atlantic for violating market rules in its reporting of its reserves

The London Stock Exchange LSE is planning to announce preferred takeover by the end of the month newspaper reports claim 
The Sunday Telegraph said the LSE's plan was further evidence it wants to retain tight control over its destiny 
Both Deutsche Boerse and rival Euronext held talks with the London market last week over possible offer 
bn offer from Deutsche Boerse has already been rejected while Euronext has said it will make an all cash bid 
Speculation suggests that Paris-based Euronext has the facilities in place to make bid of bn while its German rival may up its bid to the bn mark 
Neither has yet tabled formal bid but the LSE is expected to hold further talks with the two parties later this week 
However the Sunday Telegraph report added that there are signs that Deutsche Boerse chief executive Werner Seifert is becoming increasingly impatient with the LSE's managed bid process 
Despite insisting he wants to agree recommended deal with the LSE's board the newspaper suggested he may pull out of the process and put an offer directly to shareholders instead 
The newspaper also claimed Mr Seifert was becoming increasingly frustrated with the pace of negotiations since Deutsche Boerse's bn offer was rejected in mid-December in particular the LSE's decision to suspend talks over the Christmas period 
Meanwhile the German exchange's offer has come under fire recently 
Unions for Deutsche Boerse staff in Frankfurt have reportedly expressed fears that up to jobs would be moved to London if the takeover is successful 
Others claim it will weaken the city's status as Europe's financial centre while German politicians are also said to be angry over the market operator's promise to move its headquarters to London if bid is successful 
further stumbling block is Deutsche Boerse's control over its Clearstream unit the clearing house that processes securities transactions 
LSE shareholders fear it would create monopoly situation weakening the position of shareholders when negotiating lower transaction fees for share dealings 
LSE and Euronext do not have control over their clearing and settlement operations situation which critics say is more transparent and competitive

The EU and US have agreed to begin talks on ending subsidies given to aircraft makers EU Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson has announced 
Both sides hope to reach negotiated deal over state aid received by European aircraft maker Airbus and its US rival Boeing Mr Mandelson said 
Airbus and Boeing accuse each other of benefiting from illegal subsidies 
Mr Mandelson said the EU and US hoped to avoid having to resolve the dispute at the World Trade Organisation WTO 
With this agreement the EU and US have confirmed their willingness to resolve the dispute which has arisen between them Mr Mandelson said 
hope our negotiations in the next three months will lead to an agreement ending subsidies to development and production of large civil aircraft 
Last year the US terminated an agreement with the EU reached in which limits the subsidies countries can hand over to civil aircraft makers 
The US filed complaint against Brussels with the WTO over state aid to Airbus prompting retaliatory EU complaint over US support for Boeing 
However both sides agreed to suspend their requests for WTO arbitration at the beginning of December to allow bilateral talks to continue

Russia's renationalisation of its energy industry needs to be reversed senior government figure has warned 
Economy minister German Gref told the Kommersant newspaper that direct state involvement in oil was unjustified 
His comments follow the sale of much of oil giant Yukos to cover back taxes deal which effectively took most of the firm's assets into public ownership 
On December another senior economic adviser called the sale the swindle of the century 
Yuganskneftegaz the unit which produced of Yukos' output had been seized and sold in December for less than bn to previously unknown firm called Baikal 
Baikal promptly passed into the hands of state-controlled firm Rosneft itself shortly to merge with state gas giant Gazprom 
We used to see street hustlers do this kind of thing Andrei Illarionov then economic adviser to President Vladimir Putin told press conference 
Now officials are doing it 
Within days he was stripped of most of his responsibilities 
Mr Gref well-known opponent of nationalisation in competitive parts of the market was keen to distance himself from Mr Iliaronov's comments 
The privatisation of companies such as Yukos in the had been badly handled he said 
But he stressed that the government needed to get out of oil 
think that Rosneft and Yuganskneftegaz should it become state-owned company must be privatized he said 
Today our government is ineffective and state companies as result are for the overwhelming part ineffective as well 
And he warned that using back taxes to deal with firms like Yukos technique now being applied by the Kremlin to several other firms was mistake 
If we follow that logic we should nationalise all businesses he said 
Many large Russian companies particularly in the energy sector use complex webs of offshore companies to avoid taxes 
Mr Gref also poured cold water on President Putin's promises of doubled economic growth within decade 
The assault on Yukos' assets has been widely blamed for slowdown in economic growth in recent months 
The task is not simply to double GDP instead it is to use GDP to qualitatively improve people's lives Mr Gref told Kommersant 
We don't need simply to increase GDP but to improve its structure 
Instead of focusing on headline growth figures Russia needed to focus on better institutions such as more efficient and less corrupt court system

Exports from China leapt during over the previous year as the country continued to show breakneck growth 
The spurt put China's trade surplus sore point with some of its trading partners at six-year high 
It may also increase pressure on China to relax the peg joining its currency the yuan with the weakening dollar

The Karachi Stock Exchange KSE has recorded its largest single day gain surging to new high 
The index rose points in four hours of furious trading with many investors optimistic that political stability could bring an economic boom 
The KSE index closed at an overall gain of nearly points in the first two trading days of the week 
Energy and telecommunication stocks performed particularly well recording an rise since Monday morning 
In the KSE was the world's best performing stock market with the index rising 
Pakistani investors are expecting the KSE to repeat if not improve on its performance 
Jubilant investors danced on the streets as the market closed for the day on Tuesday confident that the boom will continue at least until the public holiday on January 
Others however who had stayed out fearing an imminent collapse because of prices overheating continued to warn that the bubble may burst any time 
That's rubbish KSE chairman Yaseen Lakhani told the BBC News website 
Whenever the market reflects Pakistan's true economic reality it is described as bubble 
Mr Lakhani feels that the market has risen on the basis of solid economic growth and its current level rests on sound foundations 
Market analysts are inclined to agree with Mr Lakhani arguing that there are number of major factors behind the KSE's performance 
Analysts argue that steady improvement in Pakistan's credit ratings by international credit rating agencies has finally begun to register in the market 
Standard Poor's upgraded Pakistan few weeks ago 
There are indications of yet another upgrade by the end of February 
Then say analysts there is corporate profitability in the current fiscal year which has gone up by from last year 
Coupled with the GDP growth expected by June this year am least surprised at the market's performance says Mr Lakhani 
One leading Karachi broker said the real reasons may be political 
If you file trillion case against Saudi money after Arab money will not go to the US any more 
lot of Arab money he says has already gone to Malaysia and Indonesia 
Pakistanis are now hoping that energy and telecoms two of the strongest sectors in Pakistan draw some of the Arab money to the KSE 
Locally too say analysts recent political developments have worked to the market's advantage 
An anti-Musharraf campaign threatened by the MMA countrywide alliance of religious parties has fizzled out 
The release of Asif Zardari former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's husband has eased political tensions between the military-backed government and the opposition Pakistan People's Party 
Most importantly say analysts the failure of talks between India and Pakistan on the Baglihar dam in Indian-administered Kashmir has not automatically led to heightened tensions 
This they say indicates that neither country is interested in raising the temperature at this stage irrespective of the state of their disagreements 
The market is abuzz with speculation that substantial investment may now start to flow in from the US country seen locally as deeply interested in defusing tensions between the South Asian neighbours

The US trade deficit widened by more than expected in October hitting record levels after higher oil prices raised import costs figures have shown 
The trade shortfall was bn bn up from September the Commerce Department said 
That pushed the month deficit to bn 
Imports rose by while exports increased by only 
weaker dollar also increased the cost of imports though this should help drive export demand in coming months 
Things are getting worse but that's to be expected said David Wyss of Standard Poor's in New York 
The first thing is that when the dollar goes down it increases the price of imports 
We are seeing improved export orders 
Things seem to be going in the right direction 

Despite this optimism significant concerns remain as to how the US will fund its trade and budget deficits should they continue to widen 
Another problem highlighted by analysts was the growing trade gap with China which has been accused of keeping its currency artificially weak in order to boost exports 
The US imported almost bn worth of goods from China during October exporting little under bn 
It seems the key worry that has existed in the currency market still remains said Anthony Crescenzi bond strategist at Miller Tabak in New York 
The trade deficit and the shortfall with China are big issues going forward

Sales of hybrid cars in the US are set to double in research suggests 
Research group JD Power estimates sales will hit in despite higher prices and customer scepticism 
Carmakers are starting to build hybrid sports utility vehicles SUVs the four-wheel-drive vehicles which now dominate the US car market 
Hybrids cut both petrol consumption and emissions by combining petrol engine with an electric motor constantly kept charged by extra engine power 
Several jurisdictions notably the state of California mandate low emissions for new cars 
Equally the rise in oil prices over the past year has sparked hopes that consumers may be tempted by potential savings of few hundred dollars year on fuel 
At the Detroit Motor Show range of manufacturers are prominently displaying their hybrid credentials 
Toyota has led the market to date with the Prius popularised by number of celebrities keen to burnish their green credentials 
In April it will launch hybrid version of its Highlander SUV with an SUV from its luxury Lexus marque due later in the year 
Honda has three hybrids on the market and between them the two Japanese carmakers sold more than units last year 
Ford which has sold of its first hybrid since its launch in August is bringing hybrid SUV the Mariner to market year ahead of schedule with plans for three more models by 
GM has hybrid pickup on the market and is showing two concept SUVs in Detroit 
Even sports car maker Porsche may join the race although it insists it is still considering whether to hybridise its Cayenne SUV 
Others remain more sceptical 
Nissan has bought Toyota's hybrid technology but plans to bring out its first model only in 
We want to make sure we are not concentrating on one technology Nissan chief executive Carlos Ghosn said 
We will not be surprised by any acceleration or deceleration in the hybrid market 
Volkswagen meanwhile says it will focus on clean-burning diesel engines instead 
And some watchers point out that the price tag on hybrid upwards of above that of an equivalent normal-engined car and suspicion of the technology may still cool its attraction 
The average consumers aren't willing to pay that premium for car they won't drive more than six years said Anthony Pratt from JD Power

Nearly two million people across Asia could be thrown into poverty because of the Indian Ocean tsunami the Asian Development Bank ADB has said 
In its first overview of the disaster the ADB said the impact on economic growth would be slight because major cities and factories escaped damage 
But the blow to many low-income people could be enormous 
The Paris Club of rich creditor nations on Wednesday offered to freeze debts owed by tsunami-hit countries 
The move was aimed at helping South Asian governments find budgets to rebuild devastated coastal areas though so far only Sri Lanka Indonesia and the Seychelles have indicated that they will take it up 
Other countries believe their economies are strong enough to cope or wish to avoid being viewed as credit risks 
Poverty is potentially the most important impact of this natural disaster said ADB chief economist Ifzal Ali 
Donor nations have promised to give in disaster relief over the next six months according to the United Nations 
Mr Ali added his voice to those warning that aid pledges must be promptly delivered saying the number of people at risk of poverty hinged on concerns over sanitation and health conditions and other basic needs being properly and quickly addressed 
There are billion people in Asia living on less than day 
The ADB fears that million Indonesians could join them while in India just over half million people are at risk of falling into poverty 
quarter of million Sri Lankans and people in the Maldives are also facing poverty 
In the Maldives where of the population already lives on less than day this could rise to half 
Sri Lanka and the Maldives are the two countries the ADB fears are most at risk of suffering lasting economic damage from the tsunami 
Sri Lanka's government has estimated reconstruction costs at nearly bn 
government task force held meetings to discuss an emergency rebuilding plan with the ADB World Bank and Japanese aid agencies on Wednesday and promised to publish the plan within days 
Indonesia Malaysia Thailand and India have enjoyed strong economic growth in recent years which should cushion them against reconstruction costs 
Although Indonesia's northern province of Aceh suffered the worst death toll the region's oil and natural gas production facilities have survived intact the report said 
However it remains too soon to asses the damage to poor people's livelihoods in Aceh because it would depend on how much farm land had been flooded by seawater 
This is profoundly tragic event for the region and for the millions who are suffering 
But the economies of the affected countries except Sri Lanka and the Maldives should emerge with minimal damage the ADB report said 
Some businesses may even gain from the reconstruction efforts thereby creating jobs 
At meeting in Thailand ABD president Thadao Chino said he was confident of the country's own capabilities to restore normalcy to the affected areas and meet the rehabilitation requirements 
Thailand has said it does not wish to opt for debt repayment freeze while India has also rejected international aid saying it can cope on its own resources 
Debt repayment holidays carry the risk of credit ratings downgrades making it more expensive to borrow money in future 
Indonesia however is pressing for greater help with its debts than the current freeze would bring 
It is one of the world's most indebted countries

The ban threatens to reignite tensions between the regulator and British American Tobacco which plans to become China's first foreign cigarette maker 
spokeswoman for Bat declined to comment on the report 
China won't allow any new tobacco factories to be built including joint ventures said Xing Wangli spokesman for the State Tobacco Administration Monopoly quoted in China Daily 
He also said that the state would retain its monopoly on cigarette distribution 
China has million smokers who consumer trillion cigarettes year 
Smoking is fashionable in China where it is seen as an essential and manly sociable touch for some jobs such as salesmen 
More young urban woman are taking up smoking too 
In July Bat announced it had won approval for to build bn joint venture factory in China which would make it the first foreign cigarette maker to manufacture there 
The State Tobacco Monopoly Administration said week later that it had not approved the deal leading to an embarrassing public row 
Bat told the BBC at that time that it had not negotiated with the STMC and secured approval from the highest levels of government 
Since then the row has flared occasionally most recently at forum in November 
Bat consistently declines to comment 
Xing's statement comes as especially bad news for British American Tobacco the China Daily newspaper said of the latest development 
The Bat spokeswoman said There is nothing for us to add 
since our announcement in July last year 
The central government of China is the authority that approved our strategic investment 
The decision to ban further tobacco factories does not apply to deals made before according to the French news agency AFP 
The joint venture factory was expected to take till to build 
The Bat spokeswoman would not comment on its progress 
However if the STMA continues to take tough stance expansion opportunities could be limited 
China's tobacco market is increasingly valuable as anti-smoking campaigners target public smoking in the West 
China Daily said the market was currently enjoying steady growth making more than bn yuan bn in pre-tax profits last year almost double the figure in 
The paper made no mention of health concerns 
The STMA is trying to restructure the domestic tobacco industry closing some factories though such moves can be unpopular with local governments

The Bank of England has left interest rates on hold again at in widely-predicted move 
Rates went up five times from November as the bank sought to cool the housing market and consumer debt but have remained unchanged since August 
Recent data has indicated slowdown in manufacturing and consumer spending as well as in mortgage approvals 
And retail sales disappointed over Christmas with analysts putting the drop down to less consumer confidence 
Rising interest rates and the accompanying slowdown in the housing market have knocked consumers' optimism causing sharp fall in demand for expensive goods according to report earlier this week from the British Retail Consortium 
The BRC said Britain's retailers had endured their worst Christmas in decade 
Today's no change decision is correct said David Frost Director General of the British Chambers of Commerce BCC 
But if there are clear signs that the economy slows the MPC should be ready to take quick corrective action and cut rates 
Dismal reports from the retail trade about Christmas sales are worrying if they indicate more general weakening in consumer spending 

Mr Frost added The housing market outlook remains highly uncertain 
It is widely accepted that if house prices start falling more sharply the risks facing the economy will worsen considerably 
CBI chief economist Ian McCafferty said the economy had slowed in recent months in response to rate rises but that it was difficult to gauge from the Christmas period the likely pace of activity through the summer 
The Bank is having to juggle the emergence of inflationary pressures driven by tight labour market and buoyant commodity prices against the risk of an over-abrupt slowdown in consumer activity he said 
Interest rates are likely to remain on hold for some time 

On Thursday there was more gloomy news on the manufacturing front as the Office for National ONS statistics revealed British manufacturing output unexpectedly fell in November for the fifth month in the past six 
The ONS said manufacturing output dropped in November matching similar unrevised fall in October and confounding economists' expectations of rise 
Manufacturers' organisation the EEF said it expected the hold in interest rates to continue in the near future 
It also said there was evidence that manufacturers' confidence may be waning as the outlook for the world economy becomes more uncertain 
So far the evidence suggests that last year's rate increases have helped to rebalance the economy without damaging the recovery in manufacturing said EEF chief economist Steve Radley 
However should the business outlook start to deteriorate the Bank should stand ready to cut rates 
Some economists have predicted rates will drop later in the year although others feel the Bank may still think there is need for rise to before that happens 
The Bank remains concerned about the long-term risks posed by personal debt which is rising at year if economic conditions worsen

The gap between US exports and imports has widened to more than bn bn an all-time record 
Figures from the Commerce Department for November showed exports down to bn while imports grew to bn on rising consumer demand 
Part of the expanding deficit came from high prices for oil imports 
But the numbers suggested the sliding dollar which makes exports less expensive has had little impact and could indicate slowing economic growth 
The trade deficit far bigger than the bn widely expected on Wall Street prompted rapid response from the currency markets 
By GMT the dollar was trading against the euro at almost cent and half weaker than before the announcement 
Against the pound the dollar was down about at 
The dollar's fall has been sudden violent and appropriate given this number said Brian Taylor of Wells Fargo in Minneapolis 
Recent exchange rate movements certainly haven't had any impact yet 
Treasury Secretary John Snow put brave face on the news saying it was sign of strong economic expansion 
The economy is growing at such fast rate that it is generating lots of disposable income 
some of which is used to buy goods from our trading partners 

Although the White House officially still backs the US's traditional strong dollar policy it has tacitly indicated that it would be happy if the slide continued 
The dollar has fallen by against the euro as well as by against the yen in the past three years 
The main catalyst most economists accept is the large budget deficit on the one hand and the current account deficit the difference between the flow of money in and out of the US on the other 
The trade deficit is large part of the latter 
In November the fall in exports was largely due to decline in sales of industrial supplies and materials such as chemicals as well as of cars consumer goods and food 
One small bright spot for US policy-makers was slight decline in the deficit with China often blamed for job losses and other economic woes 
Although China's overall trade surplus is expanding according to Chinese government figures the Commerce Department revealed the US's deficit with China was bn in November down from bn the month before 
But the deficit with Japan was at its worst in more than four years

The UK's trade gap narrowed in November helped by rise in exports outside the European Union 
According to the Office for National Statistics the difference between what the UK exported and imported was bn bn down from October's bn 
Overall UK exports including both goods and services rose by more than to bn although total imports rose again to new record of bn 
The deficit for goods alone was bn down from October's bn 
During November the UK exported bn worth of goods but imported bn 
The cumulative deficit for the first eleven months of now stands at bn bn higher than the same period in 
November saw an improvement in export levels to both the European Union and the rest of the world the Office for National Statistics ONS said 
EU exports rose fuelled by an increase in sales of chemicals 
Non-EU exports shot up with growth seen across range of manufacturing sectors including cars consumer durables and chemicals 
The export boost offset rise in imports 
Non-EU imports rose but the growth in goods entering the UK from the EU slowed to 
The UK's deficit with the EU fell to bn from bn while its non-EU shortfall dropped to bn from bn in October 
The country's surplus on trade-in-services remained steady at bn for the fifth month in row 
Paul Dales UK economist for Capital Economics said the figures represented an improvement on recent months 
However he stressed that the long-term prognosis for exports was still uncertain 
The figures are lot better than expected but the trend still remains poor he said 
There have been some very encouraging signs that the UK export recovery is starting to take hold 
But there is danger that this could be held back by the ongoing weakness of domestic demand on the continent

Six foreign-owned textile factories have closed in Lesotho leaving garment workers jobless union officers told the AP news agency 
Factory Workers Union secretary general Billy Macaefa blamed the closures on the end of worldwide textile quotas 
The quotas for developing nations ended on January gave them set share of the rich countries' markets 
They also limited the amount countries like China could export to the big markets of the United States and EU 
We understand that some owners 
were complaining that the South African rand was strong against the US dollar and they were losing when exporting textiles and clothing to the United States Mr Macaefa said at news briefing in the capital Maseru 
Lesotho's currency the maloti is fixed to the rand 
But we suspect that they left the country unceremoniously because of the end of quotas introduced by the World Trade Organization 
He said the six factories were Leisure Garments Modern Garments Precious Six Garments TW Garments Lesotho Hats and Vogue Landmark 
The owners two from Taiwan two from China one from Mauritius and one from Malaysia left over the December holiday period without informing or paying their employees he said 
Union leaders and trade campaigners have been warning that developing nations such as Lesotho Sri Lanka and Bangaldesh could lose thousands of jobs once the quotas were lifted 
In the mountainous country surrounded by South Africa it is feared as many as textile workers could lose their jobs and Mr Mafeca said he expected more companies to leave 
The assistance of US law had given Lesotho's textiles duty-free access to North American markets 
The African Growth and Opportunity Act AGOA gave sub-Saharan countries preferential access to the US market for apparel and textile products as well as wide range of other goods 
Lesotho government news briefing is expected on Wednesday

Jailed tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky has transferred his controlling stake in oil giant Yukos to business partner 
Mr Khodorkovsky handed over his entire stake in holding company Group Menatep which controls Yukos to Leonid Nevzlin 
close ally of the ex-Yukos boss Mr Nevzlin is currently based in Israel 
Mr Khodorkovsky handed over his stake after the forced sale of Yukos' core oil production unit Yuganskneftegaz to pay giant tax bill

Previously considered to be Russia's richest man with an estimated fortune of bn Mr Khodorkovsky is currently on trial for fraud and tax evasion following his arrest in October 
However the charges are widely seen as politically motivated and part of drive by Russian President Vladimir Putin to rein in the country's super-rich business leaders the so-called oligarchs

The trio are chief executive Willie Walsh chief financial officer Brian Dunne and chief operations officer Seamus Kearney 
The three have refused to confirm reports they plan to launch private airline in competition with Aer Lingus 
They announced in November they would quit in May but did not give reason 
That decision had followed an announcement by Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern who is still considering the future of the airline which ruled out proposed management buy-out of Aer Lingus 
Mr Walsh denied they had been forced out early because of the reports claiming they were set to launch competitor airline 
What do after leave Aer Lingus is still too early to say Mr Walsh told AP news agency on Wednesday 
have opportunities open to me 
Brian and Seamus are in the equally fortunate position 
He said he had received more than business proposals mostly aviation-related since the trio announced their resignations two months ago 
Mr Walsh said there was no conflict of interest and if he was to launch rival airline or join an existing competitor this thing happens in every business 
There's absolutely no question of conflict of interest 
I've been completely focused on my responsibilities at Aer Lingus he told AP 
This week opposition politicians had called on the Irish government to make an urgent decision on the future of the airline 
On Wednesday Irish Transport Minister Martin Cullen said in statement conflict of interest cannot should not and will not be allowed to arise between their current roles at Aer Lingus and their future career intentions 
Last Friday the minister had announced he was to advertise for three senior executives for Aer Lingus 
Mr Walsh who took charge in and his team have earned praise for turning Aer Lingus around by cutting air fares and staff and re-positioning it as low-fare airline to rival Ryanair 
The company is owned by the government and by its staff

The US has asked the World Trade Organisation to investigate European Union customs tariffs which it says are inconsistent and hamper trade 
The EU's own institutions have noted the uneven way EU customs rules are applied but failed to act the US Trade Representative's Office said 
Small and mid-sized US firms were worst-hit it added 
The EU expanded from to member states in May 
The US said it filed the complaint after talks failed to find solution 
The move came in the same week that the US and EU stepped back from confrontation in tense dispute over aircraft subsidies to European manufacturer Airbus and US firm Boeing 
New EU trade commissioner Peter Mandelson said on Tuesday that the two sides had agreed to reopen talks in the aircraft subsidies row which led to tit-for-tat WTO filings in last autumn 
Explaining why it has asked the WTO to set up dispute settlement panel on customs barriers the US Trade Representative's Office said that it wants to tackle the issue early in the EU's process of dealing with the problems of enlargement 
Ten countries mostly in Eastern Europe joined the EU in May 
The US said its trade with the EU member countries was worth bn bn in 
Although the EU is customs union there is no single EU customs administration statement issued on behalf of Robert Zoellick US Trade Representative said

Video games are big business the paper quoted Mr Chernin as saying

The success of products such as Sony's Playstation Microsoft's X-Box and Nintendo's Game Cube have boosted demand for video games 
The days of arcade classics such as Space Invaders Pac-Man and Donkey Kong are long gone 
Today games often have budgets big enough for feature films and look to give gamers as real an experience as possible 
And with their price tags reflecting the heavy investment by development companies video games are proving almost as profitable as they are fun 
Mr Chernin however told the FT that News Corp was finding it difficult to identify suitable target 
We are struggling with the gap between companies like Electronic Arts which comes with high price tag and the next tier of companies he explained during conference in Phoenix Arizona 
These may be too focused on one or two product lines

US prosecutors have charged nine food suppliers with helping Dutch retailer Ahold inflate earnings by more than 
The charges have been brought against individuals as well as companies alleging they created false accounts 
Ahold hit the headlines in February after it emerged that there were accounting irregularities at its US subsidiary Foodservice 
Three former Ahold top executives last year agreed to settle fraud charges 
Ahold has admitted that it fraudulently inflated promotional allowances at Foodservice improperly consolidated joint ventures and also committed other accounting errors and irregularities 
The nine now charged who worked as suppliers to Ahold are accused of signing false documents relating to the amount of money they paid the retailer for promoting their products in its stores 
Food companies pay supermarkets and retailers for prime shelf space 
The suppliers in question are said to have inflated the amount of money they paid providing auditors with signed letters that allowed Ahold to inflate its earnings 
US Attorney David Kelley said he expects the nine vendors will plead guilty to the charges 
He added that there may be more court actions in the future 
don't want to leave you with the impression that these were the only ones involved he said 
Among those facing charges are John Nettle former employee of General Mills Mark Bailin of Rymer International Seafood Tim Daly of Michael Foods and Kenneth Bowman who worked as an independent contractor for Total Foods 
Others include Michael Hannigan of Sugar Foods Peter Marion of Maritime Seafood Processors and First Choice Foods Gordon Redgate of Commodity Manager and Private Label Distribution Bruce Robinson of Basic American Foods and Michael Rogers formerly of Tyson Foods 
Pasquale D'Amuro of the FBI called the nine vendors the key ingredients in the process of cooking the books at Ahold 
At the time of the scandal Ahold was seen by many as Europe's Enron 
Ahold shares tumbled on the news and many market observers predicted that the fall out could damage investor confidence across Europe 
It was less severe than many had envisaged however and since then Ahold has worked hard at rebuilding its reputation and investor confidence 
Ahold is the world's fourth-largest supermarket chain 
Its other US businesses include Stop Shop and Giant Food

Two big US names have launched advertising campaigns to set the record straight about their products and corporate behaviour 
The world's biggest retailer Wal-Mart took out more than full page adverts in national newspapers 
The group is trying to see off criticism over it pay deals benefits package and promotion strategy 
Meanwhile drugs group Eli Lilly is planning campaign against false claims about its product Prozac 
Wal-Mart kicked off the battle with adverts in newspapers like the Wall Street Journal using an open letter from company president Lee Scott saying it was time for the public to hear the unfiltered truth 
There are lots of 'urban legends' going around these days about Wal-Mart but facts are facts 
Wal-Mart is good for consumers good for communities and good for the US economy Mr Scott said in separate statement 
Its adverts and new website outlined the group's plans to create more than US jobs in 
Wal-Mart's average pay is almost twice the national minimum wage of an hour while employees are offered health and life insurance company stock and retirement plan the adverts say 
Unions accuse Wal-Mart of paying staff less than its rivals do with fewer benefits 
In California the company is fighting opposition to new stores amid allegations it forces local competitors out of business 
Lawmakers in the state are also examining allegations that the firm burdens the state with an unfair proportion of employee health care costs 
think they are going to have tough time suddenly overcoming the perceptions of some people said Larry Bevington chairman of Save Our Community group fighting to prevent Wal-Mart opening store in Rosemead California 
Wal-Mart is also fighting two lawsuits one accusing it of discriminating against women and another alleging it discriminates against black employees 
Meanwhile Eli Lilly is launching series of adverts in dozen major newspapers to present what is says are the true facts about its anti-depressant drug Prozac 
The move is in response to British Medical Journal article that claimed missing Lilly documents linked Prozac to suicide and violent behaviour 
In the averts entitled An Open Letter from chief executive Sidney Taurel the company says the article continues to needlessly spread fear among patients who take Prozac 
It was simply wrong to suggest that information on Prozac was missing or that important research data on the benefits and possible side effects of the drug were not available to doctors and regulators the letter added 
Eli Lilly's chief medical officer Alan Breier said that the article was false and misleading as the documents it referred to were actually created by officials at the US Food and Drug Administration FDA and presented to an FDA meeting in 
Later FDA medical advisors agreed the claims were based on faulty data and there was no increased risk of suicide

Consumers for now remain willing to spend freely sustaining the US expansion 
Given that attitude the Fed remains likely to continue boosting the Fed funds rate at upcoming meetings UBS economist Maury Harris told Reuters 
Retail sales are seen as major part of consumer spending which in turn makes up two-thirds of economic output in the US 
Consumer spending has been picking up in recent years after slumping during and as the country battled to recover from its first recession of the decade and the World Trade Centre attacks 
During that time sales grew lacklustre in and year later

The US Federal Reserve said output from factories mines and utilities rose in line with forecasts from revised increase in October 
Analysts added that if the carmaking sector which saw production fall had been excluded the data would have been more impressive 
The latest increase means industrial output has grown in the past year 
Many analysts were upbeat about the prospects for the US economy with the increase in production coming on the heels of news of recovery in retail sales 
This is very consistent with an economy growing at to 
It is congruent with job growth and consumer optimism Comerica chief economist David Littman said of the figures

breakdown of the latest production figures shows mining output drove the increase surging while factory output rose

Shares in Deutsche Boerse have risen more than after shareholder fund voiced opposition to the firm's planned takeover of the London Stock Exchange 
TCI which claims to represent owners of of Deutsche Boerse's DB shares has complained that the bn bn offer for the LSE is too high 
Opposition from TCI has fuelled speculation that the proposed takeover could fail 
Rival exchange operator Euronext has also said it may bid for the LSE 
Euronext operates the Paris Amsterdam Brussels and Lisbon bourses while Deutsche Boerse runs the Frankfurt exchange 
BBC News spoke to number of analysts on Monday morning about shareholder worries over Deutsche Boerse's bid for LSE 
Although none were prepared to speak on the record most thought it was unlikely that TCI's opposition would halt the deal 
Obviously we'll have to wait and see but don't think it will make much difference 
Deutsche Boerse appears very committed said one London-based broker 
He forecast the takeover bid would succeed and was more concerned to see improvements in the daily running of the LSE 
In voicing its opposition to the planned takeover TCI said it would prefer to see Deutsche Boerse return to shareholders 
The Deutsche Boerse was prepared to pay for the LSE exceeds the potential benefits of this acquisition said TCI 
Another Deutsche Boerse shareholder on Monday also appeared to back TCI's call 
Another investor in Deutsche Boerse has supported the view that payout to shareholders would be preferable to Deutsche Boerse overpaying for the LSE Reuters news agency reported 
We prefer sensible entrepreneurial solution at price that is not too high said Rolf Dress spokesman for Union Investment 
If that cannot be achieved then we would wish for distribution of liquid assets to shareholders 
The Financial Times also reported third Deutsche Boerse shareholder as opposed to the deal 
It quoted spokesman for US-based hedge fund Atticus Capital complaining that the planned takeover appeared to be motivated by empire-building rather than the best interests of shareholders 
TCI has called for Deutsche Boerse to hold an emergency general meeting to discuss the bid for LSE 
Yet under German business law DB does not have to gain shareholder approval before making significant acquisition 
Deutsche Boerse said TCI's opposition would not change its bid approach

Australian airline Qantas could transfer as many as jobs out of its home country as it seeks to save costs according to newspaper reports 
Chief executive Geoff Dixon was quoted by The Australian newspaper as saying the carrier could no longer afford to remain all-Australian 
Unions criticised the possible move which may affect cabin and maintenance staff saying Qantas was profitable 
More than of the airline's staff are based in Australia 
Qantas confirmed it was looking at whether it might recruit and source products overseas potentially through joint ventures but said it would continue to create jobs in Australia 
Despite making record Australian dollars profit last year Qantas has argued that it needs to make considerable savings if it is to remain competitive 
We're going to have to get the lowest cost structure we can and that willmean sourcing things more and more from overseas the newspaper quoted Qantas chief executive Geoff Dixon as saying

If Qantas were to follow the lead of other airlines moving staff 'offshore' jobs could shift overseas the newspaper reported 
In statement Qantas said it was looking to build its operations overseas 
However it stressed this would not result in large scale redundancies in its home market where most of its staff are employed

We are however operating in global market and there is no room for complacency simply because we are currently profitable and successful

We could understand if Qantas was struggling airline about to go under Michael Mijatov international division secretary of the Flight Attendants Association told Agence France Presse 
Qantas announced record profit last year and is on course this year for an even greater profit so it is totally unnecessary

German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder has called for radical reform of the EU's stability pact to grant countries more flexibility over their budget deficits 
Mr Schroeder said existing fiscal rules should be loosened to allow countries to run deficits above the current limit if they met certain criteria 
Writing in the Financial Times Mr Schroeder also said heads of government should have greater say in reforms 
Changes to the pact are due to be agreed at an economic summit in March 
The current EU rules limit the size of eurozone country's deficit to of GDP 
Countries which exceed the threshold are liable to heavy fines by the European Commission although several countries including Germany have breached the rules consistently since without facing punishment 
The European Commission acknowledged last month that it would not impose sanctions on countries who break the rules 
Mr Schroeder staunch supporter of the pact when it was set up in the said exemptions were now needed to take into account the cost of domestic reform programmes and changing economic conditions 
The stability pact will work better if intervention by European institutions in the budgetary sovereignty of national parliaments is only permitted under very limited conditions he wrote 
Only if their competences are respected will the member states be willing to align their policies more consistently with the economic goals of the EU 

Deficits should be allowed to rise above Mr Schroeder argued if countries meet several mandatory criteria 
These include governments which are adopting costly structural reforms countries which are suffering economic stagnation and nations which are shouldering special economic burdens 
The proposed changes would make it harder for the European Commission to launch infringement action against any state which breaches the pact's rules 
Mr Schroeder's intervention comes ahead of meeting of the Eurozone finance ministers on Monday to discuss the pact 
The issue will also be discussed at Tuesday's Ecofin meeting of the finance ministers of all EU members 
Mr Schroeder also called for heads of government to play larger role in shaping reforms to the pact 
number of EU finance ministers are believed to favour only limited changes to the eurozone's rules

The founder and former boss of Parmalat has apologised to investors who lost money as result of the Italian dairy firm's collapse 
Calisto Tanzi said he would co-operate fully with prosecutors investigating the background to one of Europe's largest financial scandals 
Parmalat was placed into bankruptcy protection in after bn euro black hole was found in its accounts 
More than people lost money following the firm's collapse 
Mr Tanzi issued statement through his lawyer after five hours of questioning by prosecutors in Parma on January 
Prosecutors are seeking indictments against Mr Tanzi and others including several members of his family and former Parmalat chief financial officer Fausto Tonna for alleged manipulation of stock market prices and making misleading statements to accountants and Italy's financial watchdog 
Two former Parmalat auditors will stand trial later this month for their role in the firm's collapse 
apologise to all who have suffered so much damage as result of my schemes to make my dream of an industrial project come true Mr Tanzi's statement said 
It is my duty to collaborate fully with prosecutors to reconstruct the causes of Parmalat's sudden default and who is responsible 
Mr Tanzi spent several months in jail in the wake of Parmalat's collapse and was kept under house arrest until last September 
Parmalat is now being run by state appointed administrator Enrico Bondi who has launched lawsuits against banks in an effort to recover money for the bankrupt company and its shareholders 
He has alleged that these companies were aware of the true state of Parmalat's finances but continued to lend money to the company 
The companies insist they were the victims of fraudulent book-keeping 
Parmalat was declared insolvent after it emerged that billion euros bn bn it supposedly held in an offshore account did not in fact exist 
The firm's demise sent shock waves through Italy where its portfolio of top-selling food brands and its position as the owner of leading football club Parma had turned it into household name

In its quarterly economic review Deloitte said the UK economy had enjoyed golden period during the past decade with unemployment falling to near year low and inflation at its lowest since the 
But it warned that this growth had been achieved at the expense of creating major imbalances in the economy 
Deloitte's chief economic advisor Roger Bootle said The biggest hit of all is set to come from the housing market which has already embarked on major slowdown 
Whereas the main driver of the economy in recent years has been robust household spending growth this is likely to suffer as the housing market slowdown gathers pace 

Economic growth is likely to be constrained during the next few years by increased pressure on household budgets and rising taxes Deloitte believes 
Gordon Brown will need to raise about bn year in order to sustain the public finances in the short term the firm claims 
This will result in marked slowdown in growth in and compared to last year when the economy expanded by 
However Deloitte stressed that the slowdown was unlikely to have any major impact on retail prices while it expected the Bank of England to respond quickly to signs of the economy faltering 
It expects series of aggressive interest rate cuts over the next two years with the cost of borrowing falling from its current mark to by the end of 
Although may not be the year when things go completely wrong it will probably mark the start of more difficult period for the UK economy Mr Bootle

Choking traffic jams in Beijing are prompting officials to look at reorganising car parking charges 
Car ownership has risen fast in recent years and there are now two and half million cars on the city's roads 
The trouble is that the high status of car ownership is matched by expensive fees at indoor car parks making motorists reluctant to use them 
Instead roads are being clogged by drivers circling in search of cheaper outdoor option 
The price differences between indoor and outdoor lots are unreasonable said Wang Yan an official from the Beijing Municipal Commission for Development and Reform quoted in the state-run China Daily newspaper 
Mr Wang who is in charge of collecting car parking fees said his team would be looking at adjusting parking prices to close the gap 
Indoor parking bays can cost up to more than outdoor ones 
Sports fans who drive to matches may also find themselves the target of the commission's road rage 
It wants them to use public transport and is considering jacking up the prices of car parks near sports grounds 
Mr Wang said his review team may scrap the relatively cheap hourly fee near such places and impose higher flat rate during matches 
Indoor parking may be costly but it is not always secure 
Mr Wang's team are also going to look into complaints from residents about poor service received in exchange for compulsory monthly fees of up to yuan 
The Beijing authorities decided two years ago that visiting foreign dignitaries' motorcades should not longer get motorcycle outriders as they blocked the traffic 
Unclogging Beijing's increasingly impassable streets is major concern for the Chinese authorities who are building dozens of new roads to create showcase modern city ahead of the Olympic Games

China has ordered halt to construction work on big power stations including two at the Three Gorges Dam on environmental grounds 
The move is surprising one because China is struggling to increase energy supplies for its booming economy 
Last year provinces suffered black outs 
The State Environmental Protection Agency said the projects had failed to do proper environmental assessments 
Topping the list was controversial dam on the scenic upper Yangtze River 
Construction of these projects has started without approval of the assessment of their environmental impact 
they are typical illegal projects of construction first approval next said SEPA vice-director Pan Yue in statement on the agency's website 
Some of the projects may be allowed to start work again with the proper permits but others would be cancelled he said 
Altogether the agency ordered projects halted 
Other projects included petrochemicals plant and port in Fujian 
The bulk of the list was made up of new power plants with some extensions to existing ones 
The stoppages would appear to be another step in the central government's battle to control projects licensed by local officials 
However previous crackdowns have tended to focus on projects for which the government argued there was overcapacity such as steel and cement 
The government has encouraged construction of new electricity generating capacity to solve chronic energy shortages which forced many factories onto part-time working last year 
In China increased its generating capacity by or megawatts MW 
The biggest single project to be halted was the Xiluodi Dam project designed to produce MW of electricity 
It is being built on the Jinshajiang or 'river of golden sand' as the upper reaches of the Yangtze are known 
Second and third on the agency's list were two power stations being built at the bn Three Gorges Dam project on the central Yangtze an underground MW power plant and MW plant 
The Three Gorges Dam has proved controversial in China where more than half million people have been relocated to make way for it and abroad 
It has drawn criticism from environmental groups and overseas human rights activists 
The damming of the Upper Yangtze has also begun to attract criticism from environmentalists in China 
In April central government officials ordered halt to work on the nearby Nu River which is part of United Nations world heritage site the Three Parallel Rivers site which covers the Yangtze Mekong and Nu also known as the Salween according to the UK-published China Review 
That move reportedly followed protest from the Thai government about the downstream impact of the dams and critical documentary made by Chinese journalists

UK retail sales fell in December failing to meet expectations and making it by some counts the worst Christmas since 
Retail sales dropped by on the month in December after rise in November the Office for National Statistics ONS said 
The ONS revised the annual rate of growth down from the estimated in November to 
number of retailers have already reported poor figures for December 
Clothing retailers and non-specialist stores were the worst hit with only internet retailers showing any significant growth according to the ONS 
The last time retailers endured tougher Christmas was years previously when sales plunged 
The ONS echoed an earlier caution from Bank of England governor Mervyn King not to read too much into the poor December figures 
Some analysts put positive gloss on the figures pointing out that the non-seasonally-adjusted figures showed performance comparable with 
The November-December jump last year was roughly comparable with recent averages although some way below the serious booms seen in the 
And figures for retail volume outperformed measures of actual spending an indication that consumers are looking for bargains and retailers are cutting their prices 
However reports from some High Street retailers highlight the weakness of the sector 
Morrisons Woolworths House of Fraser Marks Spencer and Big Food all said that the festive period was disappointing 
And British Retail Consortium survey found that Christmas was the worst for years 
Yet other retailers including HMV Monsoon Jessops Body Shop and Tesco reported that festive sales were well up on last year 
Investec chief economist Philip Shaw said he did not expect the poor retail figures to have any immediate effect on interest rates 
The retail sales figures are very weak but as Bank of England governor Mervyn King indicated last night you don't really get an accurate impression of Christmas trading until about Easter said Mr Shaw 
Our view is the Bank of England will keep its powder dry and wait to see the big picture

Companies fail to draw up plans to cope with HIV Aids until it affects of people in country new research says 
The finding comes in report published on Thursday by the World Economic Forum Harvard and the UN aids agency 
Too few companies are responding proactively to the social and business threats said Dr Kate Taylor head of the WEF's global Health Initiative 
Nearly business leaders in countries were surveyed for Business and HIV AIDS Commitment and Action 
Dr Taylor described the level of action taken by businesses as revealed by the report as too little too late 
The issue will be highlighted to business and world leaders at the World Economic Forum which meets in Davos Switzerland next week 
The WEF report shows that despite the fact that people contract HIV Aids every day concern among businesses has dropped by in the last months 
Most have no policies in place to address the disease 
Nor could over of the business leaders surveyed say or estimate the prevalence of HIV among their staff 
The UN programme tackling Aids UNAIDS pointed out that having clear strategy for dealing with HIV Aids was good investment as well as being socially responsible 
One company that does have plan is Anglo-American the international mining company which estimates an HIV prevalence of among its -strong Southern African workforce 
Over the last two years the company has implemented extensive voluntary counselling and testing for HIV infection coupled with anti-retroviral therapy for employees progressing to Aids 
Over of the employees who have accessed and remained on treatment are well and have returned to normal work 
Effective action on HIV Aids is synonymous with good business management and leads to more profitable and sustainable operations said Brian Brink senior vice-president health at Anglo-American 
Companies should encourage all workers to know their HIV status making it as routine as monitoring blood pressure or cholesterol he said 
Providing access to treatment is critical part of this 
Across sub-Saharan Africa even in countries with an HIV prevalence of only around of companies have formal HIV Aids policies in place according to the report 
The gap is even wider in China Ethiopia India Nigeria and Russia the so-called next wave countries which are predicted to experience the highest numbers of new HIV Aids cases worldwide by 
The report adds an important building block to our understanding of how the business community is experiencing the HIV Aids epidemic and to whether and how it is reacting said David Bloom professor of economics and demography at the Harvard School of Public Health 
The WEF report concludes that businesses need to understand their exposure to HIV Aids risks and come up with good local practices to manage them 
key priority in both high and low-prevalence settings said the WEF is to establish policy based on non-discrimination and confidentiality

British children enjoy the highest average annual income in Europe more than double that of Spanish or Italian youngsters report suggests 
Children in the UK between the ages of and had an annual income of said market analyst Datamonitor 
They use pester power to get their parents to stump up nearly third of this income the report said 
As for how they spend their cash the bulk goes on personal care soft drinks and food Datamonitor said 
Datamonitor adds that British teenagers are keen on personal care because it helps them combine two seemingly contradictory emotional needs the desire to fit in and the desire to express their individuality 
British teenage girls compared to their counterparts in seven European countries are the most keen to use make-up products 
Nearly three out of four girls said they used make-up 
According to the Datamonitor report the trend marked British teenagers out as particularly important to cosmetics manufacturers as they are likely to experiment more with brands and products and form long-term beauty routines 
And the good times are likely to keep rolling for British children as the report predicts that they will still be topping the earnings table in

More than business and political leaders from around the globe are arriving in the Swiss mountain resort Davos for the annual World Economic Forum WEF 
For five days they will discuss issues ranging from China's economic power to Iraq's future after this Sunday's elections 
UK Prime Minister Tony Blair and South African President Thabo Mbeki are among the more than government leaders and heads of state leaders attending the meeting 
Unlike previous years protests against the WEF are expected to be muted 
Anti-globalisation campaigners have called off demonstration planned for the weekend 
The Brazilian city of Porto Alegre will host the rival World Social Forum timed to run in parallel with the WEF's ritzier event in Davos 
The organisers of the Brazilian gathering which brings together thousands of campaigners against globalisation for fair trade and many other causes have promised to set an alternative agenda to that of the Swiss summit 
However many of the issues discussed in Porto Alegre are Davos talking points as well 
Global warming features particularly high 
WEF participants are being asked to offset the carbon emissions they cause by travelling to the event 
Davos itself is in deep frost 
The snow is piled high across the mountain village and at night the wind chill takes temperatures down to minus and less 
Ultimately the forum will be dominated by business issues from outsourcing to corporate leadership with bosses of more than fifth of the world's largest companies scheduled to attend 
But much of the media focus will be on the political leaders coming to Davos not least because the agenda of this year's forum seems to lack an overarching theme 
Taking responsibility for tough choices is this year's official talking point hinting at welter of knotty problems 
One thing seems sure though transatlantic disagreements over how to deal with Iran Iraq and China are set to dominate discussions 
Pointedly only one senior official from President Bush's new administration is scheduled to attend 
The US government may still make conciliatory gesture just as happened year ago when Vice President Dick Cheney made surprise appearance in Davos 
Ukraine's new president Viktor Yushchenko is to speak just days after his inauguration an event that crowned the civil protests against the rigged first election that had tried to keep him from power 
The European Union's top leaders among them German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and European Commission President Manuel Barosso will be here too 
Mr Blair will formally open the proceedings although his speech will be pre-empted by French President Jacques Chirac who announced his attendance at the last minute and secured slot for special message two hours before Mr Blair speaks 
The organisers also hope that the new Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas will use the opportunity for talks with at least one of the three Israeli deputy prime ministers coming to the event list that includes Shimon Peres 
Davos fans still hark back to when talks between Yassir Arafat and Mr Peres came close to peace deal 
Mr Blair's appearance will be keenly watched too as political observers in the UK claim it is calculated snub against political rival Chancellor Gordon Brown who was supposed to lead the UK government delegation 
Microsoft founder Bill Gates the world's richest man and regular at Davos will focus on campaigning for good causes though business interests will not be wholly absent either 
Having already donated billions of dollars to the fight against Aids and Malaria Mr Gates will call on world leaders to support global vaccination campaign to protect children in developing countries from easily preventable diseases 
On Tuesday Mr Gates pledged of his own money to support the cause 
Mr Gates' company software giant Microsoft also hopes to use Davos to shore up its defences against open source software like Linux which threaten Microsoft's near monopoly on computer desktops 
Mr Gates is said to be trying to arrange meeting with Brazil's President Lula da Silva 
The Brazilian government has plans to switch all government computers from Microsoft to Linux 
At Davos global problem solving and networking are never far apart

The US budget deficit is set to hit worse-than-expected bn bn this year officials said on Tuesday 
The cost of military operations still needs to be factored in with analysts saying the deficit could end up further bn in the red 
Past Congressional Budget Office CBO forecasts said there would be bn shortfall in the fiscal year 
In recent months the dollar has weakened amid market jitters about the size of the budget and trade deficits 
In November the gap between US exports and imports widened to more than bn record figure 
The CBO says it envisages further orderly decline in the greenback over the next two years as the twin deficit drives dollar investors away 
But the non-partisan fiscal watchdog notes the declines will help exporters and boost US economic growth 
The budget deficit hit record bn in the months to September after reaching bn in the previous fiscal year 
The CBO also forecast total shortfall of bn for the years from to an improvement on previous projections 
However analysts say the new figures fail to take into account the potential trillion costs of the president's plan to revamp state pensions and extend tax cuts 
The figure could also be worsened by any further military costs 
Republicans have blamed the size of the deficit on slow economic conditions after the September attacks and ongoing military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan 
One of President George Bush's election pledges was to halve the budget deficit within five years 
But Democrats have accused the president of excluding Iraq-related costs from previous budgets to meet the aim of reducing the deficit charge which the administration denies 
On Tuesday the US administration asked Congress for additional funds for military operations

We are disappointed that the BaFin has referred to the prosecutor the question of whether action should be brought against individuals involved Citigroup said 
If the traders are found guilty they could face five-year jail term or fine Reuters reported BaFin as saying

It is now criminal investigation 
We found clues of possible market manipulation the spokeswoman said which included signs of linked bond trading ahead of the main trades on August 
Germany's Securities Trading Act says that if BaFin finds such clues it has to put the case in the hands of the prosecutor

Despite his leftist background President Lula has pursued surprisingly conservative economic policy arguing that in order to meet its social promises the government needs to first reach sustained economic growth

Indonesia no longer needs the debt freeze offered by the Paris Club group of creditors Economics Minister Aburizal Bakrie has reportedly said 
Indonesia which originally accepted the debt moratorium offer owes the Paris Club about bn bn 
Mr Bakrie told the Bisnis Indonesia newspaper that bn donors' aid package meant that the debt moratorium was unnecessary 
This aid comes on top of previously-pledged bn package 
Most of this 'normal aid' would be used to finance the country's budget deficit 
The Indonesian Economics Minister explained that the money bn in grants and in soft loans was for the rebuilding of Aceh province which was badly hit by the tsunami of December 
Nevertheless one of Mr Bakrie's deputies Mahendra Siregar told AFP news agency that Indonesia was still considering the offer by the Paris Club of rich creditor nations to temporarily suspend its debt payments 
What is true is that we are still discussing 
the Paris Club decision to find out more details such as how much of our debt will be subject to moratorium 
That's how far we are at this stage said Mr Siregar 
The member countries of the Paris Club are owed about bn this year in debt repayments by nations affected by the Indian Ocean tsunami 
Indonesia Sri Lanka and the Seychelles accepted the Paris Club offer which was criticised by some aid groups as being too little 
Thailand and India have however declined the offer with Thailand prefering to keep up with its payments while India said it would prefer to rely on its own resources rather than on international aid 
Putting off payments may lower country's rating among financial organisations making it more expensive and more difficult for them to borrow money in the future analysts said 
Separately the Indonesian government has said it will announce monthly how much it has received in foreign donations and how it has spent the money 
Welfare Minister Alwi Shihab told AP news agency that this announcement should allay suspicion of official corruption in relief operations

Growth in industrial output the main target of government efforts to impose curbs on credit and investments was in down from the previous year

China's economy is not only gathering speed thanks to domestic demand but also from soaring sales overseas 
Figures released earlier this year showed exports at six-year high in up 
Part of the impetus comes from the relative cheapness of the yuan China's currency

The US stock market watchdog's chairman has said he is willing to soften tough new US corporate governance rules to ease the burden on foreign firms 
In speech at the London School of Economics William Donaldson promised several initiatives 
European firms have protested that US laws introduced after the Enron scandal make Wall Street listings too costly 
The US regulator said foreign firms may get extra time to comply with key clause in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act 
The Act comes into force in mid- 
It obliges all firms with US stock market listings to make declarations which critics say will add substantially to the cost of preparing their annual accounts 
Firms that break the new law could face huge fines while senior executives risk jail terms of up to years 
Mr Donaldson said that although the Act does not provide exemptions for foreign firms the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC would continue to be sensitive to the need to accomodate foreign structures and requirements 
There are few if any who disagree with the intentions of the Act which obliges chief executives to sign statement taking responsibility for the accuracy of the accounts 
But European firms with secondary listings in New York have objected arguing that the compliance costs outweigh the benefits of dual listing 
The Act also applies to firms with more than US shareholders situation many firms without US listings could find themselves in 
The -shareholder threshold has drawn anger as it effectively blocks the most obvious remedy delisting 
Mr Donaldson said the SEC would consider whether there should be new approach to the deregistration process for foreign firms unwilling to meet US requirements 
We should seek solution that will preserve investor protections without turning the US market into one with no exit he said 
He revealed that his staff were already weighing up the merits of delaying the implementation of the Act's least popular measure Section for foreign firms 
Seen as particularly costly to implement Section obliges chief executives to take responsibility for the firm's internal controls by signing compliance statement in the annual accounts 
The SEC has already delayed implementation of this clause for smaller firms including US ones with market capitalisations below 
delegation of European firms visited the SEC in December to press for change the Financial Times reported 
It was led by Digby Jones director general of the UK's Confederation of British Industry CBI and included representatives of BASF Siemens and Cadbury Schweppes 
Compliance costs are already believed to be making firms wary of US listings 
Air China picked the London Stock Exchange for its secondary listing in its bn stock market debut last month 
There are also rumours that two Chinese state-run banks China Construction Bank and Bank of China have abandoned plans for multi-billion dollar listings in New York later this year 
Instead the cost of Sarbanes-Oxley has persuaded them to stick to single listing in Hong Kong according to press reports in China

Citizens in majority of nations surveyed in BBC World Service poll believe the world economy is worsening 
Most respondents also said their national economy was getting worse 
But when asked about their own family's financial outlook majority in countries said they were positive about the future 
Almost people in countries were questioned for the poll which was mostly conducted before the Asian tsunami disaster 
The poll found that majority or plurality of people in countries believed the economy was going downhill compared with respondents in nine countries who believed it was improving 
Those surveyed in three countries were split 
In percentage terms an average of of respondents in each country said the world economy was getting worse compared to who said it was improving 
Similarly were pessimistic about their national economy while were optimistic 
And saw their family's economic conditions improving as against who said they were getting worse 
The poll of people was conducted by the international polling firm GlobeScan together with the Program on International Policy Attitudes Pipa at the University of Maryland 
While the world economy has picked up from difficult times just few years ago people seem to not have fully absorbed this development though they are personally experiencing its effects said Pipa director Steven Kull 
People around the world are saying 'I'm OK but the world isn't' 
There may be perception that war terrorism and religious and political divisions are making the world worse place even though that has not so far been reflected in global economic performance says the BBC's Elizabeth Blunt 
The countries where people were most optimistic both for the world and for their own families were two fast-growing developing economies China and India followed by Indonesia 
China has seen two decades of blistering economic growth which has led to wealth creation on huge scale says the BBC's Louisa Lim in Beijing 
But the results also may reflect the untrammelled confidence of people who are subject to endless government propaganda about their country's rosy economic future our correspondent says 
South Korea was the most pessimistic while respondents in Italy and Mexico were also quite gloomy 
The BBC's David Willey in Rome says one reason for that result is the changeover from the lira to the euro in which is widely viewed as the biggest reason why their wages and salaries are worth less than they used to be 
The Philippines was among the most upbeat countries on prospects for respondents' families but one of the most pessimistic about the world economy 
Pipa conducted the poll from November to January across countries in face-to-face or telephone interviews 
The interviews took place between November and January 
The margin of error is between and points depending on the country 
In eight of the countries the sample was limited to major metropolitan areas

European leaders say Asian states must let their currencies rise against the US dollar to ease pressure on the euro 
The European single currency has shot up to successive all-time highs against the dollar over the past few months 
Tacit approval from the White House for the weaker greenback which could help counteract huge deficits has helped trigger the move 
But now Europe says the euro has had enough and Asia must now share some of the burden

former FBI agent and an internet stock picker have been found guilty of using confidential US government information to manipulate stock prices 
New York court ruled that former FBI man Jeffrey Royer fed damaging information to Anthony Elgindy 
Mr Elgindy then drove share prices lower by spreading negative publicity via his newsletter 
The Egyptian-born analyst would extort money from his targets in return for stopping the attacks prosecutors said 
Under the guise of protecting investors from fraud Royer and Elgindy used the FBI's crime-fighting tools and resources actually to defraud the public said US Attorney Roslynn Mauskopf 
Mr Royer was convicted of racketeering securities fraud obstruction of justice and witness tampering 
Mr Elgindy was convicted of racketeering securities fraud and extortion 
The charges carry sentences of up to years 
When the guilty verdict was announced by the jury foreman Mr Elgindy dropped his face into his hands and sobbed the Associated Press news agency reported 
He was led weeping from the court room by US marshals AP said 
Defense lawyers contended that Mr Royer had been feeding information to Mr Elgindy and another trader in an attempt to expose corporate fraud 
Mr Elgindy's team claimed that he also was fighting against corporate wrongdoing 
Elgindy's conviction marks the end of his public charade as crusader against fraud in the market said Ms Mauskopf 
One of the more bizarre aspects of the trial focused on the claims that Mr Elgindy may have had foreknowledge of the September terrorist attacks in New York and Washington 
Mr Elgindy had been trying to sell stock prior to the attack and had predicted slump in the market 
No charges were brought in relation to these allegations

Earlier this month China Construction Bank branch manager was jailed for life in separate case 
China's banks used to act as cash offices for state enterprises and did not require checks on credit worthiness 
The introduction of market reforms has been accompanied by attempts to modernise the banking sector but links between banks and local government remain strong 
Last year China's premier Wen Jiabao targeted bank lending practices in series of speeches and regulators ordered all big loans to be scrutinised in an attempt to cool down irresponsible lending 
China's leaders see reforming the top four banks as vital to distribute capital to profitable companies and protect the health of China's economic boom 
But two problems persist 
First inefficient state enterprises continue to receive protection from bankruptcy because they employ large numbers of people 
Second many questionable loans come not from the big four but from smaller banks 
Another high profile financial firm China Life is facing shareholder lawsuits and probe by the US Securities and Exchange Commission following its New York listing over its failure to disclose accounting irregularities at its parent company

conflict between the Argentine State and water firm Aguas Argentinas controlled by France's Suez is casting doubt on the firm's future 
The firm which serves the province of Buenos Aires wants tariff rise of to fund water-supply improvements 
The government has rejected the rise and wants Aguas Argentinas to make an annual investment of pesos in improvements 
Planning Minister Julio De Vido has offered State help but not for free 
Mr De Vido said that the Argentine state would not make contribution in the form of subsidy 
He has said contribution could be made in return for seat on the company's board 
He added that the government is in discussions with Aguas Argentinas about what role it might take in the event that State contribution is agreed 
However Aguas Argentinas told the Argentine newspaper Clarin it would not accept any change to its legal structure and in practice this rules out State participation on its board 
The Planning Minister didn't rule out the possibility of cancelling Aguas Argentinas water concession 
Yet he added that he didn't like to do futurology 
But last week Argentine Economic Minister Roberto Lavagna told the French media in Paris that the government was considering allowing increase in tariffs and the possibility of State contribution to Aguas Argentinas infrastructure investments 
Speaking in Buenos Aires Mr De Vido later denied the possibility of any tariff increase and insisted that the annual investment in water infrastructure was at the centre of the discussions 
He added that in the coming weeks the future of Aguas Argentinas would be decided 
Suez owns of Aguas Argentinas while Spain's Aguas de Barcelona is its second biggest shareholder with 
Recently Suez lost water concession in Bolivia after mass protests in the city of El Alto the poorest in the country with citizens complaining of unfair water charges 
This forced the government to cancel the contract 
In Argentina Suez's subsidiary which has been fined for cutting the supply of water during recent heat wave and allegedly failing to keep up investment to meet the demand for water has maintained tense relationship with the Argentine government 
During the last financial crisis in Argentina the firm sued the state alleging that converting its tariffs from US dollars to pesos and then freezing them during devaluation had affected the company and made it difficult for it to meet its contractual obligations 
When President Nestor Kirchner of Argentina arrived in power he began to negotiate solution to the disagreements with international utilities operating in Argentina 
But he has rejected any tariff increases alleging this will impoverish citizens further 
He has also asked for more investments to meet the growing demand for water 
On May Aguas Argentinas and the government signed an agreement to renegotiate its Buenos Aires water-concession contract 
The firm agreed to invest pesos 
The issue has attracted European interest 
Last week in Paris President Kirchner discussed this problem and other issues with French president Jacques Chirac 
The Argentine government is also under pressure from European Union countries and the International Monetary Fund IMF to raise utilities tariffs because most of the utilities operating in Argentina are European

The themes to be stressed by Mr Blair whose attendance was announced at the last minute are those he wants to dominate the UK's chairmanship of the group of industrialised states 
Other issues to be discussed at the five-day conference range from China's 
economic power to Iraq's future after this Sunday's elections 
Aside from Mr Blair more than other world leaders are expected to attend including French President Jacques Chirac due to speak by video link after bad weather delayed his helicopter and South African President Thabo Mbeki whose arrival has been delayed by Ivory Coast peace talks

Anti-globalisation campaigners have called off demonstration planned for the weekend 
At the same time about people are expected to converge on the Brazilian resort of Porto Alegre for the World Social Forum the so-called anti-Davos for campaigners against globalisation for fair trade and many other causes 
In contrast the Davos forum is dominated by business issues from outsourcing to corporate leadership with bosses of more than fifth of the world's largest companies scheduled to attend 
survey published on the eve of the conference by PricewaterhouseCoopers said four in ten business leaders were very confident that their companies would see sales rise in 
Asian and American executives however were much more confident than their European counterparts 
But the political discussions focusing on Iran Iraq and China are likely to dominate media attention

The trial of Emilio Botin the chairman of Spain's most powerful bank Santander Central Hispano has started in Madrid 
Mr Botin is accused of misusing the bank's funds after he approved the payment of euros in bonus and pension payouts to two former executives 
However the trial was suspended when Mr Botin's lawyer introduced new set of documents on the day testimony was set to begin 
three-judge panel gave prosecution lawyers until Monday to study the documents when the trial will be reconvened 
The high-profile case began after two Santander shareholders filed criminal complaint about the payments to Jose Maria Amusategui and Angel Corcostegui who stepped down in

The UK economy grew by an estimated in after accelerating in the last quarter of the year says the Office for National Statistics ONS 
The figure is in line with Treasury and Bank of England forecasts 
The ONS says gross domestic product GDP rose by strong in the three months to December compared with in the previous quarter 
The rise came despite further decline in production output and the worst Christmas for retailers in decades 
The annual figure marked out the best year since and was also well ahead of the recorded in 
Growth in the final three months of marked the th consecutive quarter of expansion 
On the basis of the latest information the UK has entered on course to continue its record period of growth said Paul Boateng chief secretary to the Treasury in statement 
The ONS said the services sector which accounts for nearly three-quarters of the UK economy grew in the quarter 
The strong services figure was welcomed by analysts given lacklustre retail sales in December and across the Christmas holiday period 
The fact that other services components are doing so well suggests to me that we are back to trend growth and am not particularly concerned about any further slowdown said Ross Walker UK economist at RBS Financial Markets 
However output in the production sector contracted the second quarterly fall in row and state of affairs that some economists classify as recession 
However the ONS would not comment on the definition of recession and whether the manufacturing recovery was over 
But Steve Radley chief economist at the manufacturers' organisation EEF said These figures remain at odds with what is actually happening on the ground 
Whilst companies may be experiencing tougher conditions this year 'recession' is not word that manufacturers would currently recognise 
The ONS said sharp fall in mining and quarrying which was driven by oil and gas extraction was primarily responsible for the overall contraction in manufacturing production figures 
Simon Rubinsohn chief economist at Gerrard said This outturn of was well ahead of the market expectations and cast doubt on the scare stories doing the rounds surrounding the current state of the UK economy 
And he said the GDP figures may help to push interest rate expectations little higher along the curve 
The suggestion from the money markets is that the next move is now more likely to be in an upward rather than downward direction 
This is consistent with our own thinking said Mr Rubinsohn 
The Bank of England's nine-strong rate-setting committee voted unanimously earlier this month to keep interest rates steady at minutes of the meeting showed on Wednesday

Richard Scrushy is accused of directing bn bn accounting fraud at the company he co-founded in Alabama in 
Prosecutors said he was motivated by wealth spending about between and while earning much less 
Defence lawyers said Mr Scrushy had been deceived by other executives 
Several former HealthSouth employees have already pleaded guilty to fraud and are expected to give evidence against Mr Scrushy 
We will present evidence that Richard Scrushy knew about the conspiracy that he participated in the conspiracy and that he profited prosecutor Alice Martin told the court 
Mr Scrushy is the first chief executive to be tried for breaching the Sarbanes Oxley Act law introduced in the wake of the Enron and WorldCom frauds which obliges corporate bosses to vouch for the accuracy of their companies' results 
Among the charges he faces are conspiracy to commit fraud filing false statements and money laundering 
After federal agents raided HealthSouth's offices in March the company said none of its past financial statements could be relied on

More than of large companies around the world are highly optimistic about their economic prospects survey of bosses suggests 
Their biggest worries are not terror threats but over-regulation low-cost competition and the wild ups and downs of oil prices 
There is one exception Firms in Western Europe but not the UK are lacking confidence after years of slow growth 
When business advisers PricewaterhouseCoopers PwC conducted the same survey two years ago nearly of bosses were gloomy about their prospects 
Global business leaders say that they are facing two-pronged regulatory assault 
After string of corporate scandals in the United States from Enron to WorldCom the Sarbanes-Oxley act forces companies to be much more transparent but doing all the paperwork costs lot of time and money 
Across Europe meanwhile all stock exchange-listed companies are currently in the process of moving to new and complex accounting standards called IFRS 
Hacking through the red tape can hardly be avoided but many chief executives around the world appear to have decided on how to deal with low-cost competitors 
Already about of the bosses polled for the survey say that they have moved parts of their business into low-wage countries and another plan to do so in the future 
Possibly as result the worry about low-cost competition has slightly fallen from last year with just of companies calling it significant threat or one of the biggest threats 
But PwC's global chief executive Samuel DiPiazza said growing number of companies were also concerned that moves to outsource work to cheaper countries could both hurt their reputation in their home markets and harm the quality of service they provide to their customers 
According to Frank Brown global advisory leader at PwC the trend of large companies to have global operations has one clear upside One risk in one region for example the Middle East won't kill your business anymore 
Surprisingly the survey suggests that the rapid decline of the US dollar is not seen as huge threat anymore unlike even year ago when it was cited as the third-largest problem 
Mr DiPiazza said the interviews with chief executives suggested that companies had adjusted to the new reality of euro that buys and more while others had successfully hedged their positions and locked in more favourable exchange rates 
For the survey PricewaterhouseCoopers interviewed chief executives throughout the world during the last three months of
